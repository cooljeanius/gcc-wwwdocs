<h1>Porting to GCC 6</h1>

<p>
The GCC 6 release series differs from previous GCC releases in
<a href="changes.html">a number of ways</a>. Some of
these are a result of bug fixing, and some old behaviors have been
intentionally changed in order to support new standards, or relaxed
in standards-conforming ways to facilitate compilation or run-time
performance.  Some of these changes are not visible to the naked eye
and will not cause problems when updating from older versions.
</p>

<p>
However, some of these changes are visible, and can cause grief to
users porting to GCC 6. This document is an effort to identify major
issues and provide clear solutions in a quick and easily searched
manner. Additions and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
