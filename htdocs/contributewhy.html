<H1>Extending and Contributing to GCC</H1>

<P>If you are writing a major extension to GCC, such as a port to a
new computer, a new language, or a major rewrite of some optimization
passes, please keep in mind the importance of keeping other developers
informed.  Part of being a good cooperating member of the GCC
development team is the responsibility to consider what the other
developers need in order to work effectively.</P>

<P>Nobody likes to do a lot of work and find it was duplicated effort.
So when you work on a major new feature, you should tell <A
HREF="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">gcc@gcc.gnu.org</A> what you are working
on, and give occasional reports of how far you have come and how
confident you are that you will finish the job.  This way, other
developers (if they are paying attention) will be aware which projects
would duplicate your effort, and can either join up with you, or at
least avoid spending time on something that will be unnecessary
because of your work.</P>

<P>You should also monitor the <A HREF="lists.html">gcc@gcc.gnu.org
list</A> to see if someone else mentions working on a similar project
to yours.  If that happens, speak up!</P>

<P>If you are thinking of taking a contract to develop changes under a
temporary delayed-release agreement, please negotiate the agreement so
that you can give progress reports before the release date, even
though you cannot release the code itself.  Also please arrange so
that, when the agreed-on date comes, you can release whatever part of
the job you succeeded in doing, even if you have not succeeded in
finishing it.  Someone else may be able to finish the job.</P>

<P>Many people have done GCC ports on their own, to a wide variety of
processors, without much communication with the GCC development team.
However, many of those ports have been lost over time, or have proven
very hard to integrate.  So, what we're asking is that, to the maximum
extent possible, you communicate with us as early on and as much as
possible.</P>

<P>Here are some questions GCC porters may have with our answers to
them.  While the focus here is on new back ends, we believe that the
issues are similar for new front ends (new languages), as well as for
student efforts to implement new compiler optimizations.</P>

<P><EM>Our engineers understand our processor better than anyone else,
and we have a tight schedule.  Why should we work with the GCC
developers, when we can get the code out faster by whacking it out on
our own?</EM></P>

<P>You understand your processor better than anyone else.  However,
the GCC developers understand GCC better than anyone else;
furthermore, the GCC developers tend to have a wide breadth of
experience across a large number of processors.  It has been our
experience that few problems encountered in compiler development are
unique to a particular processor.  The vast majority of the time an
issue that arises in one processor has also shown up in other
processors.</P>

<P>The intimate knowledge of GCC internals as well as a wide breadth
of processor knowledge means that there is a good chance that at least
one GCC developer has already addressed issues you are likely to face
when doing the port to your processor.  The developers can help guide
you towards a workable long term solution, possibly saving you
significant time in your development cycle.</P>

<P>If getting the sources into the official GCC distributions is one
of your goals, then engaging other GCC developers early will also likely
shorten your development time.  By interacting as early as possible
you are more likely to write code which can be easily accepted into
the official sources when you are finished.  If you wait until you
think you are done to begin interaction with the GCC team, you might
find that you did some things wrong and you may have to rewrite parts
of your GCC port, which is a waste of your valuable time.</P>

<P><EM>Why should we care if our port is integrated into the official
GCC sources?  We can distribute it ourselves to whoever is
interested.</EM></P>

<P>Yes, the GNU GPL allows you to do that.  But by doing so, you end up
having to maintain that code yourself; this can be a significant
effort over time as the GCC sources change rapidly.</P>

<P>You also lose the advantage of wider exposure by including your
port in the official GCC sources maintained by the GNU Project.  The
wider exposure in the GCC developer and tester community will help
keep your port up to date with the current sources.  You may even find
that volunteers will run the ever-growing test suite on your port and
fix problems during the development cycle -- sometimes without your
intervention.</P>

<P>It has been our experience that integrated ports tend to ultimately
be of better quality and stay up to date from release to release.</P>

<P><EM>Why should we communicate up front?  We're happy to let the GCC
developers integrate our stuff later.</EM></P>

<P>See above.  It will save work for you over both the short and the
long term, and it is the right thing to do.</P>

<P><EM>Aspects of my processor that my port exploits are still under
NDA.</EM></P>

<P>Nevertheless, if the processor is out, or you have customers
planning to use it, some of them may already be trying to port GCC on
their own.  Your customers might be happier to know that your port
will eventually be available.  Also, there is no requirement that GCC
use all the features of your chip from day one.</P>

<P>Assume that your processor has some new functionality that will
make a class of applications run much faster than with other
processors.  However that functionality is still covered by NDA, but
the basic core architecture is not.  It is still to your advantage to
go ahead and work with the developers early to provide a "base port"
for the chip.  That base port would only use the publicly available
specifications until such time as the NDA is lifted.  Once the NDA is
lifted you can work with the developers to provide the code necessary
to take advantage of the new functionality.</P>

<P>Ultimately, cooperating with the free software community as early
as possible helps you by decreasing your development cycle, decreasing
your long term maintenance costs and may help raise interest in your
processor by having a free compiler implementation available to anyone
who wants to take a look.</P>
