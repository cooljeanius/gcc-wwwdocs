<h1>GCC: Anonymous read-only rsync access</h1>

<p>In an ongoing effort to accelerate development of GCC and provide an
open development environment, we are offering our SVN repository and
various other data through anonymous rsync access.</p>

<p>That way you can make local copies of the GCC SVN repository to ease
the burden on the GCC main site, and browse the source locally using
<code>svn</code>.</p>

<h2>Using rsync</h2>

<p>The GCC repository is available at <code>rsync://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-svn</code>.
The whole repository takes over 12G of disk space,
which takes a substantial time to transfer.
Subsequent synchronizations will be much faster, though, as rsync uses
a smart algorithm to only transfer differences over the network.</p>

<p>Here is how you get a copy of the repository:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
rsync --archive --delete --compress \
      rsync://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-svn gcc-svn
</pre></blockquote>
<p>The same command can be run periodically to synchronize your copy of
the repository.</p>

<p>Other rsync options that you might want to use include
<code>--verbose</code> and <code>--progress</code> to provide feedback,
including during the initial phase that is otherwise silent.</p>

<p>You can get rsync from its home page, 
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org">rsync.samba.org</a>.</p>

<p>To get a list of available rsync targets, run:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
rsync rsync://gcc.gnu.org/
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Other interesting data, such as the GCC ftp directories, is also
available.</p>

<h2>Using the local repository</h2>
<p>Refer to <a href="svn.html">SVN instructions</a> to check out your
local copy of the repository.  Note that the rsync command above will
mirror the repository at its root directory, so the URL you will need
to use to check out from your local repository will look something
like <code>svn+ssh://<i>hostname</i>/usr/local/gcc-svn/</code>
(ie. without the trailing <code>/svn/gcc</code> directory names that
would be included for gcc.gnu.org access).</p>
