<h1>Porting to GCC 12</h1>

<p>
The GCC 12 release series differs from previous GCC releases in
<a href="changes.html">a number of ways</a>. Some of these are a result
of bug fixing, and some old behaviors have been intentionally changed
to support new standards, or relaxed in standards-conforming ways to
facilitate compilation or run-time performance.
</p>

<p>
Some of these changes are user visible and can cause grief when
porting to GCC 12. This document is an effort to identify common issues
and provide solutions. Let us know if you have suggestions for improvements!

<h3 id="computedgotos">Computed goto now require a pointer type</h3>

<p>
In GCC 12, computed gotos require a pointer type.
An example which was accepted before:</p>
<pre><code>
  void f(void)
  {
    goto *10;
  }
</code></pre>
is no longer accepted and you need to add a cast to it like:

<pre><code>
  void f(void)
  {
    goto *(void*)10;
  }
</code></pre>

<h3 id="co_reduce_operation">Argument name for CO_REDUCE</h3>

<p>
GCC 12 now uses <code>OPERATION</code> as the name of the function to
the <code>CO_REDUCE</code> intrinsic for the pairwise reduction, thus
conforming to the Fortran 2018 standard.  Previous versions
used <code>OPERATOR</code>, which conformed to TS 18508.
