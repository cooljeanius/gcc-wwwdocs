<h1>GCC 4.2 Release Series<br />Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<h3>C family</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The pragma <code>redefine_extname</code> will now 
        macro expand its tokens for compatibility with 
        SunPRO.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>C++</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
     The (undocumented) extension which permitted templates with
     default arguments to be bound to template template parameters with
     fewer parameters has been removed.  For example:

      <pre>
	template &lt;template &lt;typename&gt; class C&gt;
	void f(C&lt;double&gt;) {}

	template &lt;typename T, typename U = int&gt;
	struct S {};

	template void f(S&lt;double&gt;);
      </pre>      

     is no longer accepted by G++.  The reason this code is not
     accepted is that <code>S</code> is a template with two parameters;
     therefore, it cannot be bound to <code>C</code> which has only
     one parameter.
    </li>

    <li>
     The command line option <code>-fconst-strings</code>, deprecated in
     previous GCC releases, has been removed.
    </li>

    <li>
     The configure variable <code>enable-__cxa_atexit</code> is now enabled by
     default for more targets.  Enabling this variable is necessary in order for
     static destructors to be executed in the correct order, but it depends upon
     the presence of a non-standard C library in the target library in order to
     work.  The variable is now enabled for more targets which are known to have
     suitable C libraries.
    </li>
  </ul> 

<h3>Java (GCJ)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
     A new command line option <code>-static-libgcj</code> has been
     added for targets that use a linker compatible with GNU Binutils.
     As its name implies, this causes libgcj to be linked statically.
     In some cases this causes the resulting executable to start
     faster and use less memory than if the shared version of libgcj
     were used.  However caution should be used as it can also cause
     essential parts of the library to be omitted.  Some of these issues are
     discussed in:

    </li>
  </ul>
