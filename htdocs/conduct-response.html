<h1><a href="conduct.html">GCC Code of Conduct</a> Response Guide</h1>

<h2><span style="color: red;"><strong>NOTE</strong></span><strong>: The
Code of Conduct Committee, and the formal reporting and response procedures,
are not yet fully established.  The below are the currently planned procedures
for when the committee is in place.</strong></h2>

<h3>This is the process followed by the GCC Code of Conduct Committee. It's
used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're consistent and fair. It
should be considered an internal document, but we're publishing it publicly in
the interests of transparency.</h3>

<h3>The Code of Conduct Committee</h3>

<p>All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by a Code of
Conduct Committee ("the committee").</p>

<p>The Steering Committee ("SC") will establish this committee, composed of at
least three members. One member will be designated chair of the committee and
will be responsible for all reports back to the SC. The SC will review
membership on a regular basis.</p>

<h3>How the committee will respond to reports</h3>

<p>When a report is sent to the committee they will immediately reply to the
report to confirm receipt. This reply should be sent within 24 hours, and
ideally much sooner than that.</p>

<p>See the reporting guidelines for details of what reports should contain. In
addition to the report, the committee will collect all relevant data before
acting. The committee will contact all individuals involved, and refer to any
available records, to get a more complete account of events.</p>

<p>The committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best of
their ability:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what happened</li>
  <li>whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation</li>
  <li>who, if anyone, violated the code of conduct</li>
  <li>whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to anyone's physical safety</li>
</ul>

<p>This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the
committee's deliberations will be recorded and privately retained (i.e. IRC
transcripts, email discussions, recorded voice conversations, etc).</p>

<p>The committee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within one
week. In the event that a resolution can't be determined in that time, the
committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline
for resolution.</p>

<h3>Acting Unilaterally</h3>
<p>If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment in #gcc), or
involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), any committee
member may act immediately (before reaching consensus) to end the situation. In
ongoing situations, any member may at their discretion employ any of the tools
available to the committee, including bans and blocks.</p>

<p>If the incident involves physical danger, any member of the committee may --
and should -- act unilaterally to protect safety. This can include contacting
law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on behalf of the
project.</p>

<p>In situations where an individual committee member acts unilaterally, they
must report their actions to the committee for review within 24 hours.</p>

<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>The committee must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the committee
cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the committee will turn
the matter over to the Steering Committee for resolution.</p>

<p>Possible responses may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred).</li>
  <li>Offering to mediate between the individual(s) involved.</li>
  <li>A private request or reprimand from the committee to one or more
  individual(s) involved. In this case, a committee member will deliver that
  message to the individual(s) over email, cc'ing the committee.</li>
  <li>A public request or reprimand. In this case, a committee member will
  deliver that message in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. in
  IRC for an IRC violation; email for an email violation, etc.). The committee
  may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.</li>
  <li>An imposed vacation (e.g. asking someone to "take a week off" from a
  mailing list or IRC). A committee member will communicate this "vacation" to
  the individual(s). They'll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if
  they don't agree then a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this
  vacation.</li>
  <li>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all project spaces (mailing
  lists, IRC, etc.). The committee will maintain records of all such bans so
  that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to new project spaces, or
  otherwise maintained.</li>
  <li>The committee may, if it chooses, attach "strings" to a request: for
  example, the committee may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain his
  or her membership on a mailing list.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the committee
will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain
the proposed resolution. The committee will ask if this resolution is
acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the committee is
not required to act on this feedback.</p>
<p>Finally the committee will make a report for the Steering Committee. In case
the incident or report involves a current member of the Steering Committee, the
committee will provide the report only to the other Steering Committee
members.</p>
<p>The committee will never publicly discuss the issue apart from enacting an
agreed resolution.</p>

<h3>Transparency Reports</h3>
<p>The committee will produce periodic summaries of the reports received and
actions, if any, taken, without specific details.</p>

<h3>Conflicts of Interest</h3>
<p>In the event of any conflict of interest a committee member must immediately
notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary. If a report
concerns a possible violation by a current committee member, this member is
excluded from the response process. For these cases, anyone can make a report
directly to any of the committee members, as documented in the reporting
guidelines.</p>
