<h1 align="center">Egcs steering committee announcement</h1>

<p>November 10, 1998

<pre>
From its initial conception, the egcs project has strived to organize itself
in a manner which prevents any particular individual or company from having
control over the project.

To that end, when the project was formed several individuals were contacted
to make decisions for the egcs project.  These individuals come from a
variety of backgrounds and represent various groups with an interest in the
long term health of GCC.

We feel it is in the best interest of the egcs project at this time to turn
this informal group into an official steering committee, and to make public
its membership.

The primary purpose of the steering committee is to make major decisions in
the best interests of the egcs project and to ensure that the project adheres
to its fundamental principles found in the project's mission statement.


I would also like to take this opportunity to publicly thank everyone on the
steering committee for their help in getting this project off the ground and
making it successful.  --  Marc
