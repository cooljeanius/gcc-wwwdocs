<p>The GCC steering committee was founded in 1998 with the intent
of preventing any particular individual, group or organization from
getting control over the project. It's primary purpose is to make major
decisions in the best interests of the GCC project and to ensure that
the project adheres to its fundamental principles found in the project's
<a href="gccmission.html">mission statement</a>.  [see the original
announcement below].

<h2>The original announcement from November 10, 1998:</h2>

<pre>
From its initial conception, the GCC project (formerly known as the EGCS
project) has strived to organize itself in a manner which prevents any
particular individual or company from having control over the project.

To that end, when the project was formed several individuals were contacted
to make decisions for the GCC project.  These individuals come from a
variety of backgrounds and represent various groups with an interest in the
long term health of GCC.

We feel it is in the best interest of the GCC project at this time to turn
this informal group into an official steering committee, and to make public
its membership.

The primary purpose of the steering committee is to make major decisions in
the best interests of the GCC project and to ensure that the project adheres
to its fundamental principles found in the project's mission statement.


I would also like to take this opportunity to publicly thank everyone on the
steering committee for their help in getting this project off the ground and
making it successful.  --  Marc
