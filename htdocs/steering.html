<h1>GCC steering committee</h1>

<p>The steering committee was founded in 1998 with the intent
of preventing any particular individual, group or organization from
getting control over the project. Its primary purpose is to make major
decisions in the best interests of the GCC project and to ensure that
the project adheres to its fundamental principles found in the project's
<a href="gccmission.html">mission statement</a>.  [see the original
announcement below].</p>

<p>In April 1999 the steering committee was appointed by the FSF as the
official GNU maintainer for GCC and changed its name to GCC steering
committee.</p>

<h2>GCC steering committee members</h2>

<p>The steering committee consists of the following members.  The best
place to reach them is the gcc <a href="lists.html">mailing list</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>David Edelsohn (IBM)</li>
<li>Kaveh R. Ghazi</li>
<li>Jeffrey A. Law (Ventana Micro Systems)</li>
<li>Marc Lehmann (nethype GmbH)</li>
<li>Jason Merrill (Red Hat)</li>
<li>David Miller (Red Hat)</li>
<li>Toon Moene (Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut)</li>
<li>Joseph Myers (CodeSourcery / Mentor Graphics) [co-Release Manager]</li>
<li>Gerald Pfeifer (SUSE)</li>
<li>Ramana Radhakrishnan </li>
<li>Joel Sherrill (OAR Corporation)</li>
<li>Ian Lance Taylor (Google)</li>
<li>Jim Wilson (SiFive)</li>
</ul>

<p>Membership in the steering committee is a personal membership.
Affiliations are listed for identification purposes only; steering
committee members do not represent their employers or academic
institutions.
Generally speaking, committee members were chosen to represent
the interests of communities (e.g. Fortran users, embedded systems
developers, kernel hackers), not companies.</p>

<h2>The original announcement from November 10, 1998</h2>

<pre>
From its initial conception, the egcs project [now GCC]
has strived to organize itself in a manner which prevents any
particular individual or company from having control over the project.

To that end, when the project was formed several individuals were contacted
to make decisions for the GCC project.  These individuals come from a
variety of backgrounds and represent various groups with an interest in the
long term health of GCC.

We feel it is in the best interest of the GCC project at this time to turn
this informal group into an official steering committee, and to make public
its membership.

The primary purpose of the steering committee is to make major decisions in
the best interests of the GCC project and to ensure that the project adheres
to its fundamental principles found in the project's mission statement.


I would also like to take this opportunity to publicly thank everyone on the
steering committee for their help in getting this project off the ground and
making it successful.  --  Marc
