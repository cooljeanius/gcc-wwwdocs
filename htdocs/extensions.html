<h1>GCC extensions</h1>

<p>This is a list of (experimental) extensions to GCC which, for one
reason or the other, did not (yet) make it into the official source
tree. Please direct feedback and bugreports to their respective
maintainers, not our mailing lists.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www-mount.ee.umn.edu/~okeefe/mcerg/gcc-dlx.html">DLX port</a></h2>
<p>A GCC Machine Description for the DLX machine described in Computer
Architecture: A Quantitative Approach by Hennessy and Patterson.</p>

<h2><a href="http://pdp10.nocrew.org/gcc/">PDP-10 port</a></h2>
<p>This is an experimental port of GCC to the DEC PDP-10
architecture.</p>


<h2><a name="libgxx"></a><a href="http://people.redhat.com/manfredh/libgxx/">Libg++</a></h2>

<p><code>Libg++</code>, the GNU C++ library, is an attempt to
provide a variety of C++ programming tools and other support to
GNU C++ programmers.  It has been available for quite some time
now, and, although it has been superseded by <code>libstdc++</code>,
it is still providing some useful services. And, it has proven to
be a good testsuite for the compiler...</p>

<h2>
Bounds checking patches for
<a href="http://web.inter.NL.net/hcc/Haj.Ten.Brugge/">GCC releases</a>
and
<a href="ftp://nscs.fast.net/pub/binaries/boundschecking">GCC snapshots</a>
</h2>

<p>These patches add a <code>-fbounds-checking</code> flag that
adds bounds checking tests to pointer and array accesses.
Richard Jones developed the
<a href="http://www-ala.doc.ic.ac.uk/~phjk/BoundsChecking.html">
patches against gcc-2.7</a> in 1995.
Herman ten Brugge is the current maintainer and has updated the patches for
gcc-2.95.2.
<a href="mailto:william@nscs.fast.net">William Bader</a> has unofficial
updates for selected GCC snapshots.</p>

<p>You may freely mix object modules compiled with and without bounds
checking.  The bounds checker also includes replacements for
<code>mem*</code> and <code>str*</code> routines and can detect
invalid calls against checked memory objects, even from modules
compiled without bounds checking.</p>

<p>Here is a
<a href="ftp://nscs.fast.net/pub/binaries/boundschecking/example.html#Example">
compilation and execution</a> of an example program.</p>

<p>These patches are unrelated to the fat pointer bounds checking
patches by Greg McGary &lt;gkm@eng.ascend.com&gt; which change the
size of pointers and require building modified versions of libc and
most other libraries that your program calls.  Greg's patches will
eventually be incorporated into GCC.  If you can use Greg's fat
pointer bounds checker, it has the advantage of better run-time
performance and support for languages other than C.</p>

<h2>
<a href="http://www.immunix.org/stackguard.html">StackGuard</a></h2>

<p>StackGuard emits programs hardened against "stack smashing" attacks on
x86 GNU/Linux. StackGuard 2.0 is based on egcs-1.1.2 (gcc version 2.91.66);
StackGuard 1.21 is based on gcc-2.7.2.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.cacheprof.org">Cacheprof</a></h2>

<p>An open-source tool for investigating cache effects in programs
(on x86 GNU/Linux, though possibly portable to other x86 POSIX targets).

<h1>GCC Museum</h1>

<p>In this section you will find extensions which do not (directly)
apply to current GCC sources but are of historical interest or may
be helpful to consult for future development.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/gsptools.html">Development
tools for the TMS340x0</a></h2>

<p>A GCC port to a <em>bit-addressable</em> architecture.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.goof.com/pcg/index.html">PentiumGCC</a></h2>

<p>The PentiumGCC (short PGCC) was an extension of GCC specifically
aimed at the newer Intel chips and their clones.</p>
