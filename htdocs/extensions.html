<h1>GCC extensions</h1>

<p>This is a list of (experimental) extensions to GCC which, for one
reason or the other, did not (yet) make it into the official source
tree. Please direct feedback and bug reports to their respective
maintainers, not our mailing lists.</p>


<h2><a href="http://pdp10.nocrew.org/gcc/">PDP-10 port</a></h2>
<p>This is an experimental port of GCC to the DEC PDP-10
architecture.</p>


<h2>
Bounds checking patches for
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/boundschecking/">GCC releases</a>
</h2>

<p>These patches add a <code>-fbounds-checking</code> flag that
adds bounds checking tests to pointer and array accesses.
Richard Jones developed the
<a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~phjk/BoundsChecking.html">
patches against gcc 2.7</a> in 1995.
Herman ten Brugge is the current maintainer and has updated the patches for
GCC 2.95.2 and later.
William Bader has
<a href="http://williambader.com/bounds/example.html#download">patches
as well</a>.</p>

<p>You may freely mix object modules compiled with and without bounds
checking.  The bounds checker also includes replacements for
<code>mem*</code> and <code>str*</code> routines and can detect
invalid calls against checked memory objects, even from modules
compiled without bounds checking.</p>

<p>These are extensions which do not (directly) apply to current GCC
sources but may be of historical interest or helpful to consult for
future development.</p>
