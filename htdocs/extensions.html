<h1>GCC extensions</h1>

<p>This is a list of (experimental) extensions to GCC which, for one
reason or the other, did not (yet) make it into the official source
tree. Please direct feedback and bugreports to their respective
maintainers, not our mailing lists.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www-mount.ee.umn.edu/~okeefe/mcerg/gcc-dlx.html">DLX port</a></h2>
<p>A GCC Machine Description for the DLX machine described in Computer
Architecture: A Quantitative Approach by Hennessy and Patterson.</p>

<h2><a href="http://pdp10.nocrew.org/gcc/">PDP-10 port</a></h2>
<p>This is an experimental port of GCC to the DEC PDP-10
architecture.</p>


<h2>
Bounds checking patches for
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/boundschecking/">GCC releases</a>
</h2>

<p>These patches add a <code>-fbounds-checking</code> flag that
adds bounds checking tests to pointer and array accesses.
Richard Jones developed the
<a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~phjk/BoundsChecking.html">
patches against gcc 2.7</a> in 1995.
Herman ten Brugge is the current maintainer and has updated the patches for
GCC 2.95.2 and later.
William Bader has
<a href="http://williambader.com/bounds/example.html#download">patches
as well</a>.</p>

<p>You may freely mix object modules compiled with and without bounds
checking.  The bounds checker also includes replacements for
<code>mem*</code> and <code>str*</code> routines and can detect
invalid calls against checked memory objects, even from modules
compiled without bounds checking.</p>


<h2><a href="http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/trl/projects/security/ssp/">ProPolice
Stack-Smashing Protector</a></h2>

<p>ProPolice automatically inserts stack-smashing protection code into an
application at compile time to detect buffer overflow and corruption of
pointers.</p>

<h1>GCC Museum</h1>

<p>In this section you will find extensions which do not (directly)
apply to current GCC sources but are of historical interest or may
be helpful to consult for future development.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/gsptools.html">Development
tools for the TMS340x0</a></h2>

<p>A GCC port to a <em>bit-addressable</em> architecture.</p>

<h2><a name="libgxx"></a><a href="http://www.suse.de/~mh/libgxx/">Libg++</a></h2>

<p><code>Libg++</code>, the GNU C++ library, has been superseded by
<code>libstdc++</code>.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.goof.com/pcg/index.html">PentiumGCC</a></h2>

<p>The PentiumGCC (short PGCC) was an extension of GCC specifically
aimed at the newer Intel chips and their clones.</p>
