<h1 align="center">GCC extensions</h1>


<p>This is a list of (experimental) extensions to GCC which, for one
reason or the other, did not (yet) make it into the official source
tree. Please direct feedback and bugreports to their respective
maintainers, not our mailing lists.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.goof.com/pcg/index.html">PentiumGCC</a></h2>
<p>The PentiumGCC (short PGCC) is an extension of GCC specifically
aimed at the newer Intel chips and their clones (Pentium, PPro,
Pentium-II and the Cyrix6x86 and AMD-K6+ chips). The current goal is
to enhance GCC to a point where it generates code as fast as PGCC,
but until that work is finished PGCC is still maintained, and often
achieves substantial speed improvements over GCC.</p>

<h2><a href="http://medo.fov.uni-mb.si/mapp/uTools/">ATMEL AVR port</a></h2>
<p>This is an experimental port for the 8bit ATMEL AVR micro
controllers.</p>

<h2><a href="http://home.worldnet.fr/stcarrez/m68hc11_port.html">M68HC11
port</a></h2>
<p>This is a port of GCC, GDB and the Binutils for Motorola 68HC11
(later 68HC12). This port supports 8,16,32 and 64-bits integers
as well as 32 and 64-bits floats. It uses ELF32 for object files and
DWARF-2 for debugging information.

<h2><a name="sun-make"><a href="ftp://ftp.axis.se/pub/users/hp/gcc/gcc-2.95.1-sun-make-patch1.txt">Patch
to build elsewhere than in the source directory using Sun make</a></h2>

<p>If, for some reason, you cannot use GNU make nor build in the
<i>srcdir</i>, this patch for GCC 2.95.1 will allow you to build GCC
using Sun make in a <i>srcdir</i> != <i>objdir</i> setup.</p>

<p>Apply it with (for example) GNU patch:
<blockquote><code>
patch -p1 -d <i>/path/to/gcc-2.95.1</i> &lt;
gcc-2.95.1-sun-make-patch1.txt
</code></blockquote>
This patch is not supposed to interfere with proper building and
installation on non-Sun systems or when using GNU make.</p>
