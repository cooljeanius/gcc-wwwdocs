<p>December 3, 1997

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of egcs-1.0.

<p>egcs is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers using
an open development model to accelerate development and testing of GNU
compilers and runtime libraries.

<p>An important goal of egcs is to allow wide scale testing of experimental
features and optimizations; therefore, egcs contains some features and
optimizations which are still under development.  However, egcs has been
carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to most gcc releases.

<p>egcs-1.0 is based on an August 2, 1997 snapshot of the gcc-2.8 development
sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found in gcc-2.8.


<p>egcs-1.0 also contains many improvements and features not found in gcc-2.7
and even the soon to be released gcc-2.8 compilers.
<ul>
  <li>Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
  linux systems!
  <li>The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of 
  <a href="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL">SGI's STL release.</a>
  <li>Integrated GNU Fortran compiler
  <li>New instruction scheduler
  <li>New alias analysis code
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="features.html"> new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features.

<p>The egcs-1.0 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel directory
of the egcs-1.0 distribution).  However, we also keep the most up to date
<a href="install/index.html"> installation instructions </a>
and <a href="buildstat.html"> build/test status </a> on our web page.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.

<p>And, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html"> caveats </a> to using egcs.

<p>Update: The T1 into our main California offices has been 100% saturated
since shortly after the release.  We've added an egcs-1.0 mirror at our
Massachusetts office to help share the load.  We also encourage folks to
use the many mirrors available throughout the world.

<p>Update: Big thanks to Stanford for providing a high speed link for
downloading egcs! (go.cygnus.com)

<p>We'd like to thank the numerous people that have contributed new
features, test results, bugfixes, etc.  Unfortunately, they're far
too numerous to mention by name.
