<h1>Porting to GCC 13</h1>

<p>
The GCC 13 release series differs from previous GCC releases in
<a href="changes.html">a number of ways</a>. Some of these are a result
of bug fixing, and some old behaviors have been intentionally changed
to support new standards, or relaxed in standards-conforming ways to
facilitate compilation or run-time performance.
</p>

<p>
Some of these changes are user visible and can cause grief when
porting to GCC 13. This document is an effort to identify common issues
and provide solutions. Let us know if you have suggestions for improvements!
</p>

<h2 id="cxx">C++ language issues</h2>

<h3 id="header-dep-changes">Header dependency changes</h3>
<p>Some C++ Standard Library headers have been changed to no longer include
other headers that were being used internally by the library.
As such, C++ programs that used standard library components without
including the right headers will no longer compile.
</p>
<p>
The following headers are used less widely in libstdc++ and may need to
be included explicitly when compiling with GCC 13:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>
  (for <code>std::string</code>, <code>std::to_string</code>,
  <code>std::stoi</code> etc.)
</li>
<li> <code>&lt;system_error&gt;</code>
  (for <code>std::error_code</code>, <code>std::error_category</code>,
  <code>std::system_error</code>).
</li>
<li> <code>&lt;cstdint&gt;</code>
  (for <code>std::int8_t</code>, <code>std::int32_t</code> etc.)
</li>
<li> <code>&lt;cstdio&gt;</code>
  (for <code>std::printf</code>, <code>std::fopen</code> etc.)
</li>
<li> <code>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</code>
  (for <code>std::strtol</code>, <code>std::malloc</code> etc.)
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="P2266">Implicit move rules change</h3>
<p>
GCC 13 implements C++23 <a href="https://wg21.link/p2266">P2266</a> which
simplified the rules for implicit move.  As a consequence, valid C++20
code that relies on a returned <em>id-expression</em>'s being an lvalue
may change behavior or fail to compile in C++23.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>
   decltype(auto) f(int&& x) { return (x); }  // returns int&&; previously returned int&
   int& g(int&& x) { return x; }  // ill-formed; previously well-formed
</code></pre>

<h3 id="two-stage-or">Two-stage overload resolution for implicit move removed</h3>
<p>GCC 13 removed the two-stage overload resolution when performing
implicit move, whereby the compiler does two separate overload resolutions:
one treating the operand as an rvalue, and then (if that resolution fails)
another one treating the operand as an lvalue.  In the standard this was
introduced in C++11 and implemented in gcc in
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=4ce8c5dea53d80736b9c0ba6faa7430ed65ed365">
r251035</a>.  In
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git/?p=gcc.git;a=commitdiff;h=1722e2013f05f1f1f99379dbaa0c0df356da731f">
r11-2412</a>, the fallback overload resolution was disabled in C++20 (but
not in C++17).  Then C++23 <a href="https://wg21.link/p2266">P2266</a>
removed the fallback overload resolution, and changed the implicit move
rules once again.</p>

<p>The two overload resolutions approach was complicated and quirky, so users
should transition to the newer model.  This change means that code that
previously didn't compile in C++17 will now compile, for example:</p>

<pre><code>
   struct S1 { S1(S1 &&); };
   struct S2 : S1 {};

   S1
   f (S2 s)
   {
     return s; // OK, derived-to-base, use S1::S1(S1&&)
   }
</code></pre>

<p>Conversely, code that used to work in C++17 may not compile anymore.
For example, the following example used to compile in C++11...17 because
we performed two separate overload resolutions: one treating the operand
as an rvalue, and then (if that resolution failed) another one treating
the operand as an lvalue.<br>

<pre><code>
   struct W {
     W();
   };

   struct F {
     F(W&);
     F(W&&) = delete;
   };

   F fn ()
   {
     W w;
     return w; // use w as rvalue -> use of deleted function F::F(W&&)
   }
</code></pre>

<h3 id="excess-precision">Excess precision changes</h3>

<p>GCC 13 implements <a href="changes.html#cxx">excess precision
support</a>, which was implemented just in the C front end before,
in C++. The new behavior is enabled by default in
<code>-std=c++</code><em>NN</em> modes and when
<code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code> is 1 or 2 and affects the behavior of
floating point constants and expressions.</p>

<p>E.g. for <code>FLT_EVAL_METHOD</code> equal to 2 on ia32

<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
void foo (void) { if (1.1f + 3.3f != 1.1L + 3.3L) abort (); }
void bar (void) { double d = 4.2; if (d == 4.2) abort (); }
</code></pre>

will not abort with standard excess precision, because constants and expressions
in <code>float</code> or <code>double</code> are evaluated in precision of
<code>long double</code> and demoted only on casts or assignments, but will
abort with fast excess precision, where whether something is evaluated in
<code>long double</code> precision depends on what evaluations are
done in the i387 floating point stack or are spilled from it.</p>

</p>The <code>-fexcess-precision=fast</code> option can be used to
request the previous behavior.</p>

<h3 id="alloc-rebind">allocator_traits&lt;A&gt;::rebind_alloc&lt;A::value_type&gt; must be A</h3>

<p>
GCC 13 now checks that allocators used with the standard library
can be "rebound" to allocate memory for a different type,
as required by the allocator requirements in the C++ standard.
If an allocator type <code>Alloc&lt;T&gt;</code>
cannot be correctly rebound to another type <code>Alloc&lt;U&gt;</code>,
you will get an error like this:
</p>

<pre>
.../bits/alloc_traits.h:70:31: error: static assertion failed: allocator_traits&lt;A&gt;::rebind_alloc&lt;A::value_type&gt; must be A
</pre>

<p>
The assertion checks that rebinding an allocator to its own value type is a
no-op, which will be true if its <code>rebind</code> member is defined correctly.
If rebinding it to its own value type produces a different type,
then the allocator cannot be used with the standard library.
</p>

<p>
The most common cause of this error is an allocator type
<code>Alloc&lt;T&gt;</code> that derives from
<code>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;</code> but does not provide its own
<code>rebind</code> member. When the standard library attempts to rebind the
allocator using <code>Alloc&lt;T&gt;::rebind&lt;U&gt;</code> it finds the
<code>std::allocator&lt;T&gt;::rebind&lt;U&gt;</code> member from the base
class, and the result is <code>std::allocator&lt;U&gt;</code> instead of
<code>Alloc&lt;U&gt;</code>.
</p>

<p>
The solution is to provide a correct <code>rebind</code> member as shown
below.  A converting constructor must also be provided, so that that an
<code>Alloc&lt;U&gt;</code> can be constructed from an
<code>Alloc&lt;T&gt;</code>, and vice versa:
</p>
<pre><code>
template&lt;class T&gt;
class Alloc
{
  Alloc();
  <b>
  template&lt;class U&gt; Alloc(const Alloc&lt;U&gt;);

  template&lt;class U&gt; struct rebind { using other = Alloc&lt;U&gt;; };
  </b>
  // ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>
Since C++20, there is no <code>rebind</code> member in
<code>std::allocator</code>, so deriving your own allocator types from
<code>std::allocator</code> is simpler and doesn't require the derived
allocator to provide its own <code>rebind</code>.
For compatibility with previous C++ standards, the member should still be
provided. The converting constructor is still required even in C++20.
