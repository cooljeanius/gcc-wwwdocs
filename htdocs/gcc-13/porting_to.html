<h1>Porting to GCC 13</h1>

<p>
The GCC 13 release series differs from previous GCC releases in
<a href="changes.html">a number of ways</a>. Some of these are a result
of bug fixing, and some old behaviors have been intentionally changed
to support new standards, or relaxed in standards-conforming ways to
facilitate compilation or run-time performance.
</p>

<p>
Some of these changes are user visible and can cause grief when
porting to GCC 13. This document is an effort to identify common issues
and provide solutions. Let us know if you have suggestions for improvements!
