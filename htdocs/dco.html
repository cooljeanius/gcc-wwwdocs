<h1>Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO) Sign-off</h1>

<p>The GCC project now allows contributions to use the "sign-off" procedure
originally introduced by the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst">Linux
Kernel</a> project, and subsequently adopted by many other free software
projects.  This procedure is required for contributions not covered by either
FSF copyright assignment or the MAINTAINERS DCO list.</p>

<p>The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to
pass it on as a free software patch.  The rules are pretty simple: if you
  can certify the below:</p>

<h4><a href="https://developercertificate.org">Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1</a></h4>

<p>By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
  have the right to submit it under the open source license
  indicated in the file; or</li>

<li>The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
  of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
  license and I have the right under that license to submit that
  work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
  by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
  permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
  in the file; or</li>

<li>The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
  person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
  it.</li>

<li>I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
  are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
  personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
  maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
  this project or the open source license(s) involved.</li>
</ol>

then you just add a line saying:

<pre>    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer &lt;random@developer.example.org></pre>

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)  This
will be done for you automatically if you use `git commit -s`.

<p>Some people also put extra optional tags at the end.  The GCC project does
not require tags from anyone other than the original author of the patch, but
other people involved in passing along the patch can add their own
Signed-off-by if they wish.</p>

<p>Developers with <a href="gitwrite.html">write access</a> should certify the DCO
for all their patches by adding themselves to the DCO list in the MAINTAINERS
file.</p>
