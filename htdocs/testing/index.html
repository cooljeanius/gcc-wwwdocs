<h1>GCC Testing Efforts</h1>

<p>This page describes regular efforts to test GCC thoroughly, plus ideas
for additional testing by volunteers who have machine cycles to spare.
For basic information about running the GCC testsuites, see
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/test.html">Installing GCC: Testing</a>.
For information about testsuite organization and adding new tests, see
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Test-Suites.html">
Test Suites</a> in the GCC Internals manual and the README files in
the test suite directories.</p>

<h2>Current efforts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ben Elliston operates a Tinderbox-style build and regression
      testing presentation system called
      <a href="http://people.redhat.com/bje/flametree/">Flametree</a>.</li>

  <li>Several people perform regular builds and regression test runs and
      send their test results to the
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/">gcc-testresults
      mailing list</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ideas for further testing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Perform regular builds and testing of current GCC sources that
      are not already being reported regularly; see
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/test.html">Installing GCC:
      Testing</a> for instructions on submitting test results.</li>
  <li>If your system is beefy enough, do regular builds and test runs with
      RTL consistency checks enabled.  This slows the compiler down by an
      order of magnitude but has found plenty of bugs in the past.</li>
  <li>Set up an autobuilder (see
      <a href="http://people.redhat.com/geoffk/gcc-regression/">
      gcc-regression</a>) to nag people in e-mail when they submit
      patches that break builds.  Ideally we would have one of these
      for at least each of the primary evaluation platforms listed in
      the current release criteria, but the more the merrier.
      Kaveh Ghazi &lt;<a href="mailto:ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu">
      ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu</a>&gt; suggests that the autobuilders
      should keep track of regressions in the number of warnings and nag
      patchers until the new warnings are fixed, just as for testsuite
      regressions.</li>
  <li>Build and test some or all of the following applications, some of
      which are part of the GCC release criteria.  If the instructions
      are incomplete for your target, update them.  Additions to this
      list (accompanied with build and test guides) are welcome.

  <li>If the operating system kernel you use is normally compiled with
      GCC, try building it with the current sources.  Make sure it boots.
      If you're building with relatively stable GCC sources such as a
      release branch, use the newly built kernel for running further GCC
      tests (keeping in mind the NO WARRANTY section of the GPL).</li>
  <li>Build and test applications that are important to you; investigate
      and report any problems you find.</li>
  <li>Build and test packages that are normally available on your
      platform and for which you have access to source.</li>
  <li>Run benchmarks regularly and report performance regressions.</li>
</ul>
