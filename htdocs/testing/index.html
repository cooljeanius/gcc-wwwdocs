<h1>GCC Testing Efforts</h1>

<p>This page describes regular efforts to test GCC thoroughly, plus ideas
for additional testing by volunteers who have machine cycles to spare.
For basic information about running the GCC testsuites, see
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/test.html">Installing GCC: Testing</a>.
For information about testsuite organization and adding new tests, see
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Testsuites.html">
Test Suites</a> in the GCC Internals manual and the README files in
the test suite directories.</p>

<h2>Current efforts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Phil Edwards runs a build and regression tester referred to as
      the which tries to nag people via email when they break things.
      It pays special attention to C++ binary compatibility.</li>

  <li>Several people perform regular builds and regression test runs and
      send their test results to the
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/">gcc-testresults
      mailing list</a>.</li>

  <li><a href="http://people.freebsd.org/~ljrittle/daily-gcc-bootstrap-reports/">
      Loren J. Rittle operates daily builds and regression tests</a> with
      machine time donated by the FreeBSD project.</li>

  <li>Michael Chastain runs the GDB test suite regularly and looks for
      regressions caused by GCC debug output changes.  He tests native
      i686-pc-linux-gnu once every 4-10 days, and reports to the <a
      href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/">gcc-testresults</a>
      and <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/gdb-testers/">gdb-testers</a>
      mailing lists.</li>

  <li>Dan Miles and Al Stone implemented scripts to collect all of the
      e-mail sent to the
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/">gcc-testresults
      mailing list</a>,
      and store it in a database.  Every four hours, the database contents
      are condensed into a
      <a href="http://www.toolchain.org/testresults/">results summary</a>
      that indicates whether the various versions of the compiler
      on the various platforms have progressed or regressed since 
      the previous report.  By clicking on the thumbnail graphs in the
      summary, one can see graphs of all reported test results for a
      particular platform and compiler version over time.  Further,
      all of the original test results e-mailed can be viewed by
      platform, by compiler version, or individually.  Suggestions
      for improvements or bug reports are always welcome.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ideas for further testing</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Perform regular builds and testing of current GCC sources that
      are not already being reported regularly; see
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/test.html">Installing GCC:
      Testing</a> for instructions on submitting test results.</li>
  <li>Build cross compilers and test with simulators as described in
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/simtest-howto.html">How to test GCC
      on a simulator</a>.</li>
  <li>If your system is beefy enough, do regular builds and test runs with
      RTL consistency checks enabled.  This slows the compiler down by an
      order of magnitude but has found plenty of bugs in the past.</li>
  <li>Set up an autobuilder (see
      <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/regtest/">
      gcc-regression</a>) to nag people in e-mail when they submit
      patches that break builds.  Ideally we would have one of these
      for at least each of the primary evaluation platforms listed in
      the current release criteria, but the more the merrier.
      Kaveh Ghazi &lt;<a href="mailto:ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu">
      ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu</a>&gt; suggests that the autobuilders
      should keep track of regressions in the number of warnings and nag
      patchers until the new warnings are fixed, just as for testsuite
      regressions.  It's important to have the autobuilders coordinate
      with each other, to avoid flooding contributors with mail.</li>
  <li>Build and test some or all of the following applications, some of
      which are part of the GCC release criteria.  Links for downloads
      and for information about the packages are available in the build
      and test guides.  If the instructions
      are incomplete for your target, update them.  Additions to this
      list (accompanied with build and test guides) are welcome.

  <li>If the operating system kernel you use is normally compiled with
      GCC, try building it with the current sources.  Make sure it boots.
      If you're building with relatively stable GCC sources such as a
      release branch, use the newly built kernel for running further GCC
      tests (keeping in mind the NO WARRANTY section of the GPL).</li>
  <li>Build and test applications that are important to you; investigate
      and report any problems you find.</li>
  <li>Build and test packages that are normally available on your
      platform and for which you have access to source.</li>
  <li>Run benchmarks regularly and report performance regressions.</li>
</ul>
