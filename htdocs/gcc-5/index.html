<h2>References and Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
GNU Compiler Collection.</p>

<p>A list of <a href="buildstat.html">successful builds</a> is updated
as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that have
contributed new features, improvements, bug fixes, and other changes as
well as test results to GCC.
This <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Contributors.html">amazing
