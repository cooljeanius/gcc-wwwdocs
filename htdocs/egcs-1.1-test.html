<h1 align="center">egcs-1.1 test strategy</h1>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="regress.html"> No testsuite regressions on major platforms</a>.  DONE.

  <li> libg++ addon builds and passes on same platforms as we do testsuite
       regressions on.  DONE.

  <li> Builds glibc and passes glibc testsuite on major supported platforms
       (x86, alpha, sparc).  Testing on powerpc and m68k would also be
       appreciated.

       <br>We are testing a development version of glibc.  The sources for
       testing can be found on the 
       <a href="ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/infrastructure/egcs-glibc-test.tar.gz"> egcs ftp server</a>

       <br>x86 has successfully passed the glibc test.
       <br>ppc has passed using different versions of the glibc sources
       <br>alpha "passed" (failures were glibc problems, not compiler problems).
       <br>sparc and m68k are untested


  <li> Linux kernel builds and runs (and 2.1.115).  Platforms will be
       x86, alpha.  Sparc & PowerPC kernel tests would also be greatly
       appreciated.

       <br>x86 has passed the kernel test (2.1.115)

       <br>ppc has passed using different versions of the kernel

       <br>alpha has had problems with 2.1.115, 2.1.116.  Some success with
       2.1.117, but it still locks up.  Could be a kernel problem.  A different
       person has reported success with 2.1.115 through 2.1.118.

       <br>sparc is untested
       
  <li> Red Hat 5.1 builds without errors on x86, Alpha.  
       <ul>
	<li> x86 failures
	  <ul>
	    <li> There are minor C++ violations in guavac, sgml-tools and
		 linuxconf.  These are not egcs failures.
	    <li> We've built all the appropriate SRPMS and installed the
		 resulting binaries, then rebuilt the SRPMS again.
	  </ul>
	<li> Alpha failures  I've been told this was about 90% done.  Not
	     sure if there are any compiler problems to deal with.
	<li> Sparc failures
	<li> PowerPC failures
       </ul>

  <li> RTEMS builds on the following RTEMS targets:
       <ul>
          <li> hppa1.1
	  <li> i386, i386-elf, i386-go32
	  <li> i960
          <li> m68k
          <li> mips64orion
          <li> powerpc
          <li> sh, sh-elf
          <li> sparc
       </ul>
</ul>
