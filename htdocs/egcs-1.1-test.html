<h1 align="center">egcs-1.1 test strategy</h1>

<p> This is very preliminary.  Expect it to change and be refined as the
steering committee settles on a test strategy for egcs-1.1.

<ul>
  <li> No testsuite regressions on major platforms (to be defined) relative
       to egcs-1.0.3a or gcc-2.8.1 (both would be preferable).

  <li> libg++ add on builds and passes on same platforms as we do testsuite
       regressions on.

  <li> Builds glibc and passes glibc testsuite on major supported platforms
       (to be defined).  We'll be testing a development version of glibc, not
       any currently released version.  We will place a tag on the glibc
       sources to provide a common reference point for testing.

  <li> Linux kernel builds and runs (2.0.34 and 2.1.??? TBD).  Platforms to
       be determined.

  <li> Red Hat 5.1 builds without errors on x86, Alpha (and Sparc?, PPC?).

  <li> RTEMS builds on the following RTEMS targets:
       <ul>
          <li> hppa1.1
	  <li> i386, i386-elf, i386-go32
	  <li> i960
          <li> m68k
          <li> mips64orion
          <li> powerpc
          <li> sh, sh-elf
          <li> sparc
       </ul>
</ul>
