<h1>PowerPC ABI Changes in GCC 3.4</h1>

<p>The GCC 3.4 release series fixed several cases in which earlier
   releases did not follow the proper calling conventions.  These
   fixes unfortunately did not all happen in one release, so in certain
   rare cases code will be incompatible when using different compiler
   versions within the release series.</p>


<h2>Fixed in 3.4.0</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><code>_Complex</code> integer types smaller than
    <code>_Complex long</code>, and <code>_Complex</code> floating point
    types smaller than <code>_Complex double</code> were passed and
    returned incorrectly in one register instead of the real and
    imaginary components being in separate registers.  This has been
    fixed for PowerPC64 GNU/Linux and AIX, with PowerPC GNU/Linux and
    Darwin opting to stay compatible with GCC 3.3.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Under <code>-mabi=altivec</code>, PowerPC64 GNU/Linux used to
    pass vector arguments to non-prototyped functions only in vector
    registers.  Without a prototype the argument is supposed to be
    passed in both vector registers and in general purpose registers or
    on the stack.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>DWARF2 debug information failed to use the correct numbers for
    registers other than general purpose or floating point registers.
    This affected both PowerPC and PowerPC64 GNU/Linux.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Many bugs fixed related to mixed-mode code, that is, use of
    64-bit instructions and data on a 32-bit ABI.  Previously, 64-bit
    values such as long long were passed in one register instead of
    being split into separate 32-bit registers as required by the ABI.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Zero size arrays were incorrectly passed by reference in GCC
    3.3.1 and GCC 3.3.0, a regression from GCC 3.2.  This was fixed
    in GCC 3.3.2.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Small structures passed by value were passed at the wrong end of
    registers, or padded at the wrong end in memory, or passed on the
    stack when they should be passed in registers.  AIX and PowerPC64
    GNU/Linux support has been changed to comply with their respective
    ABIs, which necessarily introduces an incompatibility with GCC 3.3.
    &quot;Small&quot; here means less than eight bytes for the 64-bit
    ABIs, and less than four bytes for AIX-32.</li>
  </ul>


<h2>Fixed in 3.4.1</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Under <code>-mabi=no-altivec</code>, vector parameters were not
    aligned, and wrong code was used to access them if the target
    function used vector instructions.  Furthermore,
    <code>-maltivec</code> affected the way vector parameters were
    passed and returned.  This affected all ABIs, both 32-bit and
    64-bit.  The fix necessarily introduces an incompatibility
    between GCC 3.3 and GCC 3.4, but not for the more common
    <code>-mabi=altivec</code> case.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>PowerPC GNU/Linux had a number of problems with functions
    accepting variable arguments, with disagreement between caller and
    callee over where arguments were to be found.  Affected were: all
    <code>_Complex</code> types, 128-bit <code>long double</code>, and
    vectors under <code>-mabi=altivec</code> when all vector registers
    had been used.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>PowerPC64 GNU/Linux and AIX generated incorrect code for certain
    <code>_Complex</code> types in functions accepting variable
    arguments.  <code>_Complex</code> integer types smaller than
    <code>_Complex long</code>, and <code>_Complex</code> floating
    point types smaller than <code>_Complex double</code>, were not
    properly repackaged from registers used to pass the values.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>A 128-bit <code>long double</code> partially passed in
    <code>f13</code> (because <code>f2</code> .. <code>f12</code> were
    used for other floating point arguments) also incorrectly used
    <code>f14</code> instead of passing the remainder of the argument on
    the stack.  Affected PowerPC64 GNU/Linux, AIX, and Darwin.</li>
  </ul>


<h2>Fixed in 3.4.2</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Arguments requiring alignment, and also passed partly in
    registers and partly on the stack, did not have all the stack words
    written.  This bug affected AIX-32 and Darwin in the following cases:
    <ul><li>Under <code>-mabi=altivec</code>, vector arguments passed in
    the variable argument part of a function with an ellipsis in the
    prototype.</li>
    <li>Under <code>-mabi=no-altivec</code>, all vector arguments.</li></ul>
    To be affected by this bug, the vector argument needs to be passed
    in <code>r9</code>, <code>r10</code> and two stack words, and
    <code>r8</code> not be used for passing other arguments.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>AIX-32 didn't pass 128-bit <code>long double</code> correctly
    if it needed to be passed both in general purpose and floating point
    registers (variable argument functions, or not prototyped).  For
    example, if the <code>long double</code> should have been passed
    partially in <code>r8</code>, <code>r9</code>, <code>r10</code> then
    only <code>r8</code> was set.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>A 128-bit <code>long double</code> passed partially in floating
    point registers and partially on the stack caused a compiler abort
    on PowerPC64 GNU/Linux and AIX-64.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Mixed-mode parameter passing bugs fixed for PowerPC GNU/Linux.
    Somehow, PowerPC GNU/Linux missed the fixes applied for the other
    32-bit ABIs for GCC 3.4.0.</li>
  </ul>
