<h1>GCC 3.4 Release Series<br />Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>With <code>-nostdinc</code> the preprocessor used to ignore
        both standard include paths <strong>and</strong> include paths
        contained in environment variables.  It was neither documented
        nor intended that environment variable paths be ignored, so
        this has been corrected.</li>
    <li>GCC no longer accepts the options <code>-fvolatile</code>,
	<code>-fvolatile-global</code> and <code>-fvolatile-static</code>.
	It is unlikely that they worked correctly in any 3.x release.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li></li>
  </ul>

  
<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<h3>C/ObjC/C++</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Precompiled headers are now supported.  Precompiled headers
        can dramatically speed up compilation of some projects.  There
        are some restrictions; read the manual for the details.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>C++</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>A hand-written recursive-descent C++ parser has replaced the
        YACC-derived C++ parser from previous GCC releases.  The new
        parser contains much improved infrastructure needed for better
        parsing of C++ source codes, handling of extensions, and clean
        separation (where possible) between proper semantics analysis
        and parsing.  The new parser fixes many bugs that were found
        in the old parser.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Objective-C</h3>

  <ul>
    <li></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Java</h3>

  <ul>
    <li></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Fortran</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Fortran improvements are listed in              
    <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/g77/News.html">
    the Fortran documentation</a>.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Support for the SH2E processor has been added to the SH port.
    Enabled at run time with the <code>-m2e</code> command line
    switch, or at configure time by specifying sh2e as the machine
    part of the target triple.</li>
    
    <li>Support for the Cirrus EP9312 Maverick floating point
    co-processor added to the ARM port.  Enabled at run time with the
    <code>-mcpu=ep9312</code> command line switch.  Note however that
    the multilibs to support this chip are currently disabled in
    <code>gcc/config/arm/t-arm-elf</code>, so if you want to enable their
    production you will have to uncomment the entries in that
    file.</li>
  </ul>


<h2><a name="obsolete_systems">Obsolete Systems</a></h2>

  <p>Support for a number of older systems has been declared obsolete in
  GCC 3.4.  Unless there is activity to revive them, the next release of
  GCC will have their sources permanently <strong>removed</strong>.</p>

  <p>All configurations of the following processor architectures have
  been declared obsolete:</p>

  <ul>
    <li></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Also, some individual systems have been obsoleted:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <ul>
	<li>target <code>target-triple</code></li>
      </ul></li>
  </ul>


<h2>Documentation improvements</h2>


<h2>Other significant improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The build system has undergone several significant cleanups.
        Subdirectories will only be configured if they are being built, 
        and all subdirectory configures are run from the <code>make</code>
        command.</li>
    <li>The <code>-W</code> warning option has been renamed to
        <code>-Wextra</code>, which is more easily understood.  The older
        spelling will be retained for backwards compatibility.</li>
  </ul>
