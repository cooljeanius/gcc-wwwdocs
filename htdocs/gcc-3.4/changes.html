<h1>GCC 3.4 Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>With <code>-nostdinc</code> the preprocessor used to ignore
        both standard include paths <strong>and</strong> include paths
        contained in environment variables.  It was neither documented
        nor intended that environment variable paths be ignored, so
        this has been corrected.</li>
