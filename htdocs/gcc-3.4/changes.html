<h1>GCC 3.4 Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>With <code>-nostdinc</code> the preprocessor used to ignore
        both standard include paths <strong>and</strong> include paths
        contained in environment variables.  It was neither documented
        nor intended that environment variable paths be ignored, so
        this has been corrected.</li>
    <li>Support for all the systems <a
        href="../gcc-3.3/changes.html#obsolete_systems">obsoleted in 
        GCC 3.3</a> has been removed from GCC 3.4.  See <a
        href="#obsolete_systems">below</a> for a list of systems which 
        are obsoleted in this release.</li>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
  </ul>

  
<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<h3>C/ObjC/C++</h3>

  <ul>
  </ul>

<h3>C++</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>A hand-written recursive-descent C++ parser has replaced the
        YACC-derived C++ parser from previous GCC releases.  The new
        parser contains much improved infrastructure needed for better
        parsing of C++ source codes, handling of extensions, and clean
        separation (where possible) between proper semantics analysis
        and parsing.  The new parser fixes many bugs that were found
        in the old parser.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Objective-C</h3>

  <ul>
  </ul>

<h3>Java</h3>

  <ul>
  </ul>

<h3>Fortran</h3>

  <ul>
  </ul>

<h2>New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
  </ul>


<h2><a name="obsolete_systems">Obsolete Systems</a></h2>

  <p>Support for a number of older systems has been declared obsolete in
  GCC 3.4.  Unless there is activity to revive them, the next release of
  GCC will have their sources permanently <strong>removed</strong>.</p>

  <p>All configurations of the following processor architectures have
  been declared obsolete:</p>

  <ul>
  </ul>

  <p>Also, some individual systems have been obsoleted:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <ul>
	<li>target <code>target-triple</code></li>
      </ul></li>
  </ul>


<h2>Documentation improvements</h2>


<h2>Other significant improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The build system has undergone several significant cleanups.
        Subdirectories will only be configured if they are being built, 
        and all subdirectory configures are run from 'make'.</li>
  </ul>
