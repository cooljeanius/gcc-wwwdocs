<h1 align="center">GCC Snapshots</h1>

<p>We recommend that you use <a href="cvs.html">CVS to access our
current development sources</a>, but we also make snapshots available
for FTP download.</p>

<p>Please use our
<a href="ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/sourceware/gcc/">main mirror
site</a> or any of our other <a href="mirrors.html">mirrors</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, some of our contributors also provide pre-built binaries
of our current development sources on a regular base:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.netwinder.org/build/gcc.html">armv3l, armv4l, and
    i386</a> by netwinder.org.
<li><a href="http://www.codesourcery.com/gcc-snapshots.html">i386</a> by
    CodeSourcery.
</ul>
