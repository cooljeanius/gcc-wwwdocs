<h1>GCC Snapshots</h1>

<p>We recommend that you use <a href="git.html">Git to access our
current development sources</a>.</p>

<p>We also make regular snapshots available for download from our
<a href="mirrors.html">mirror sites</a> about once
a week. These snapshots are intended to give everyone access to work in
progress.  Any given snapshot may generate incorrect code or even fail to
build.</p>

<p>If you plan on downloading and using snapshots, we highly recommend you
subscribe to the GCC <a href="lists.html">mailing lists</a>.</p>

<p>When using the diff files to update from older snapshots to newer snapshots,
make sure to use "-E" and "-p" arguments to patch so that empty files are
deleted and full pathnames are provided to patch.</p>

<p><code>contrib/gcc_update</code> can be used to apply diffs between
successive snapshot versions and preserve relations between generated
files so that autoconf et al aren't needed.</p>

<p>The program <code>sha512sum</code> &mdash; which is included with the 
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">GNU Coreutils</a>
&mdash; can be used to verify the integrity of a snapshot or release.
The release script generates the file 
<code>sha512.sum</code> that provides a 512-bit checksum for the tarball
and other files in the snapshot directory.&nbsp; Use the following command
to verify the sources:<br />
 
<code>sha512sum --check --ignore-missing sha512.sum</code></p>

<!--
<p>In addition, some of our contributors also provide pre-built binaries
of our current development sources on a regular basis:</p>
