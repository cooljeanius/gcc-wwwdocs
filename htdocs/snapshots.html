<h1 align="center">GCC Snapshots</h1>

<p>We recommend that you use <a href="cvs.html">CVS to access our
current development sources</a>, although we also make regular
snapshots available for FTP download.</p>

<p> We make snapshots of the GCC sources about once a week; there is no
predetermined schedule.  These snapshots are intended to give everyone
access to work in progress.  Any given snapshot may generate incorrect code
or even fail to build.</p>

<p>If you plan on downloading and using snapshots, we highly recommend you
subscribe to the GCC mailing lists.  See <a href="lists.html">
mailing lists</a> on the main GCC page for instructions on how to subscribe.</p>

<p>When using the diff files to update from older snapshots to newer snapshots,
make sure to use "-E" and "-p" arguments to patch so that empty files are
deleted and full pathnames are provided to patch.  If your version of
patch does not support "-E", you'll need to get a newer version.  Also note
that you may need autoconf, autoheader and various other programs if you use
diff files to update from one snapshot to the next.</p>

<p>contrib/gcc_update can be used to apply diffs between successive
snapshot versions and preserve relations between generated files so
that autoconf, bison et al aren't needed. This is documented in
comments in contrib/gcc_update. <BR> The file .brik provides a list of
checksums of files in the snapshot, that may be checked using<BR>
brik -C &lt; .brik</p>

<p>Please use our <a href="mirrors.html">mirror sites</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, some of our contributors also provide pre-built binaries
of our current development sources on a regular basis:</p>
