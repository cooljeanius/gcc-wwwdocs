<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>Any help concerning open issues is highly welcome, as are
suggestions.  Suggestions accompanied by patches have a higher chance
of being implemented soon. ;-)</p>

<ul>
<li>Complete MetaHTML machinery on the egcs machine and convert all
    pages to some common style. [Gerald]
<li>Move extra pages corresponding to technical news items into a
    directory of their own. Add an index for these.
<li>Move bug reporting information from faq.html to bugs.html (making the
    old entry a link).
<li>Write down some information concerning the benchmark suite, for
    non-insiders. [Marc Lehmann]
<li>Write down some information concerning the testsuite.
    This might be combined with the previous item. [Marc Lehmann]
<li>Investigate faq-o-matic to supplement (or possibly replace) the FAQ we
    are currently maintaining.
<li>Restore contents of install/specific.html once the testsuite has been
    added again.
</ul>
