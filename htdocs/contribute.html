<dl>
  
  <dt><b>Coding Standards:</b></dt>

  <dd>All contributions must conform to the <a
  href="http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/prep/standards_toc.html"> GNU Coding
  Standards</a>.  Submissions which do not conform to the standards will
  be returned with a request to reformat the changes.<p>
  </dd>


  <dt><b>Copyright Assignment:</b></dt>

  <dd>Before we can accept code contributions from you, we need a
  copyright assignment form filled out.

  <ul>
   <li>If you've developed some addition or patch to egcs
   that you would like to contribute, you should fill out a <a
   href="fsf-forms/assignment-instructions.html">copyright assignment
   form</a> and send it in to the FSF.  We are unable to use code from
   you until this is on-file at the FSF, so get that paperwork in!

   <li>The above form is for a one-time change submission; you can
   fill out a different assignment to give all future copyrights
   (for a particular program) to the Free Software Foundation.
   If you think you're going to be doing continuing work on egcs
   (including gcc, g++, g77, Objective C, libstdc++, etc.),
   it will be easiest if you can fill out this form, called <a
   href="fsf-forms/assign.future">assign.future</a>.  Please note that
   you'll need to fill out the assign.future form again if you switch
   employers.

   <li>There are several <a href="fsf-forms/copyrights.html">other forms
   you can fill out</a> for different circumstances (e.g. to contribute
   an entirely new program, to contribute significant changes to a
   manual, etc.)

   <li>Small changes can be accepted without a copyright assignment form
   on file.

  <li>This is pretty confusing!  If you are unsure of what is necessary,
  just ask
   the <tt>egcs</tt> mailing list and we'll figure out what is best
   for you.

 </ul>

  <p>Note:  Many of these forms have a place for "name of program".
  Insert the name of <b>one</b> program in that place, "gcc", "g77",
  "libstdc++", etc.  Do <b>not</b> write "egcs" in that location.  If
  you use "egcs" or multiple program names, the FSF will reject the
  assignment and we won't be able to use your contribution.
  </dd>


  <dt><b>Submitting Patches:</b></dt>

  <dd>Every patch must have several pieces of information before we can
  properly evaluate it.

  <ul>
  <li> A description of the bug and how your patch fixes this bug.  For
       new features a description of the feature and your implementation.
  <li> A ChangeLog entry as plaintext; see the various ChangeLog files
       for format and content.<br>
       Note that, unlike some other projects, we do require ChangeLogs
       also for documentation (i.e., .texi files).
  <li> The patch itself.  If you are accessing the <a href="cvs.html">
       CVS repository</a> at Cygnus, use "cvs update; cvs diff"; else use
       "diff -c3p OLD NEW" or "diff -up OLD NEW".  If your
       version of diff does not support these options, then get the
       latest version of GNU diff.
  </ul>

  When you have all these pieces, bundle them up in a mail message and
  send it to <a href="mailto:egcs-patches@cygnus.com">egcs-patches@cygnus.com</a>.
