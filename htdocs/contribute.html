<h1 align="center">Contributing to GCC</h1>

<p>We strongly encourage contributions of code, bug fixes, new
optimizations, new features, documentation updates, web page
improvements, etc. for GCC.</p>

<p>There are certain legal requirements and style issues which all
contributions must meet.</p>

<h2>Coding Standards</h2>

<p>All contributions must conform to the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html">GNU Coding
Standards</a>.  There are also some <a
href="codingconventions.html">additional coding conventions for
GCC</a>; these include documentation and testsuite requirements as
well as requirements on code formatting.  Submissions which do not
conform to the standards will be returned with a request to address
any such problems.</p>

<h2>Copyright Assignment</h2>

<p>Before we can accept code contributions from you, we need a
copyright assignment form filled out and filed with the FSF.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain.html#SEC6">See some
documentation by the FSF</a> for details and contact us (either via
the <a href="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">gcc@gcc.gnu.org</a> list or the
GCC maintainer that is taking care of your contributions) to obtain
the relevant forms.  It's a good idea to send
<a href="mailto:assignments@gnu.org">assignments@gnu.org</a> a copy of
your request.</p>

<p>Small changes can be accepted without a copyright assignment form
on file.</p>

<h2><a name="testing">Testing Patches</a></h2>

<p>All patches must be thoroughly tested.  We encourage you to test
changes with as many host and target combinations as is practical.  In
addition to using real hardware, you can
<a href="simtest-howto.html">use simulators</a> to increase your test
coverage.</p>

<p>Much of GCC's code is used only by some targets, or used in quite
different ways by different targets.  When choosing targets to test a
patch with, make sure that your selections exercise all aspects of the
code you are changing.  For instance, a change to conditional branch
handling should be tested both with targets that use <code>cc0</code>,
and targets that don't.</p>

<p>You will of course have tested that your change does what you
expected it to do: fix a bug, improve an optimization, add a new
feature.  If the test framework permits, you should automate these
tests and add them to GCC's test suite.  You must also perform
regression tests to ensure that your patch does not break anything
else.</p>

<p>If your change is to code that is not in a front end, or is to the
C front end, you must perform a complete build of GCC and the runtime
libraries included with it, on at least one target.  You must
bootstrap all languages, not just C.  You must also run all of the
test suites included with GCC and its runtime libraries.  For a normal
native configuration, running <code>make bootstrap</code> followed by
<code>make -k check</code> from the top level of the GCC tree
(<strong>not</strong> the <code>gcc</code> subdirectory) will
accomplish this.</p>

<p>If your change is to a front end other than the C front end, or a
runtime library other than <code>libgcc</code>, you need to verify
only that the runtime library for that language still builds and the
tests for that language have not regressed.  (Most languages have
tests stored both in the <code>gcc</code> subdirectory, and in the
directory for the runtime library.)  You need not bootstrap, or test
other languages, since there is no way you could have affected
them.</p>

<p>Since the Ada front end is written in Ada, if you change it you
must perform a complete bootstrap; however, running other language
test suites is not necessary.</p>

<p>Documentation changes do not require a bootstrap, but you must
perform <code>make info</code> and <code>make dvi</code> and correct
any errors.  You should investigate complaints about overfull or
underfull hboxes from <code>make dvi</code>, as these can be the only
indication of serious markup problems, but do not feel obliged to
eliminate them all.</p>

<p>Changes to the web site must
<a href="http://validator.w3.org/">validate</a> as XHTML 1.0
Transitional.  The web pages as checked into CVS do not include
DOCTYPE declarations; they are automatically added when the web server
checks out its copy.  To validate your changes, temporarily insert
this header in place of the &lt;html&gt; tag, then use the "upload
file" mode of the validator.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html 
          PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
          "DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"&gt;
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en"&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>In all cases you must test exactly the change that you intend to
submit; it's not good enough to test an earlier variant.  The tree
where you perform this test should not have any other changes applied
to it, because otherwise you cannot be sure that your patch will work
correctly on its own.  Include all your new test cases in your
testsuite run.</p>

<h2>Submitting Patches</h2>

<p>Every patch must have several pieces of information before we can
properly evaluate it:</p>

<dl>

<dt>A description of the problem/bug and how your patch addresses it.</dt>
<dd>
For new features a description of the feature and your implementation.
For bugs a description of what was wrong with the existing code, and a
reference to any previous bug report (in the <a href="gnats.html">GCC
GNATS database</a> or the <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/">gcc-bugs archives</a>) and any
existing testcases for the problem in the GCC testsuite.
</dd>

<dt>Testcases</dt>
<dd>
If you cannot follow the recommendations of the <a
href="codingconventions.html">GCC coding conventions</a> about
testcases, you should include a justification for why adequate
testcases cannot be added.
</dd>

<dt>ChangeLog</dt>
<dd>
A ChangeLog entry as plaintext; see the various ChangeLog files for
format and content, and the <a href="codingconventions.html">GCC
coding conventions</a> and <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html">GNU Coding
Standards</a> for further information.  The ChangeLog entries should
be plaintext rather than part of the patch since the top of the
ChangeLog changes rapidly and a patch to the ChangeLog would probably
no longer apply by the time your patch is reviewed.
</dd>

<dt>Bootstrapping and testing</dt>
<dd>
State the host and target combinations you used to do the testing
described above, and the results of your testing.
</dd>

<dt>The patch itself</dt>
<dd>
If you are accessing the <a href="cvs.html">CVS repository</a> at
gcc.gnu.org, use &quot;<code>cvs update; cvs diff -c3p</code>&quot;;
else, use &quot;<code>diff -c3p OLD NEW</code>&quot; or
&quot;<code>diff -up OLD NEW</code>&quot;.  If your version of diff
does not support these options, then get the latest version of GNU
diff.  Patches against current development (mainline CVS) are
preferred to patches against releases, unless your patch is intended
as a candidate for the release branch.
</dd>

</dl>

<p>Don't mix together changes made for different reasons.  Send them
<em>individually</em>.  Ideally, each change you send should be
impossible to subdivide into parts that we might want to consider
separately, because each of its parts gets its motivation from the
other parts.  In particular, changes to code formatting to conform to
coding standards are best not mixed with substantive changes, because
that makes it difficult to see what the real changes are.  (In the
case of a very large reorganization of code, it may make sense to
separate changes even further to make it clearer what has changed; for
example, by first sending structural changes that make subsequent
changes easier but do not change GCC's behavior, then new code, then
the changes that actually make use of the new code and change GCC's
behavior.)</p>

<p>We prefer patches posted as plain text or as MIME parts of type
<code>text/x-patch</code> or <code>text/plain</code>, disposition
<code>inline</code>, encoded as <code>7bit</code> or
<code>8bit</code>.  If the patch is too big or too mechanical, posting
it gzipped or bzip2ed and uuencoded or encoded as a
<code>base64</code> MIME part is acceptable, as long as the ChangeLog
is still posted as plain text.  Other than that, it is strongly
discouraged to post patches as MIME parts of type
<code>application/</code><i>whatever</i>, disposition
<code>attachment</code> and/or encoded as <code>base64</code> or
<code>quoted-printable</code>.  Avoid MIME large-message splitting
(<code>message/partial</code>) at all costs.</p>

<p>When you have all these pieces, bundle them up in a mail message
and send it to <a
href="mailto:gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org">gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org</a>.
All patches and related discussion should be sent to the gcc-patches
mailing list.  For further information on the GCC CVS repository, see
the <a href="cvs.html">Anonymous read-only CVS access</a> and <a
href="cvswrite.html">Read-write CVS access</a> pages.</p>

<p>If you do not receive a response to a patch that you have submitted
within a month or so, it may be a good idea to chase it by sending a
follow-up email to <a
href="mailto:gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org">gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org</a>.
Patches can occasionally fall through the cracks. Please be sure to
include the URL of the entry in the mailing list archive of the
original submission.</p>

<p>Patches to the standard C++ library (libstdc++-v3), and its web
pages, and discussion of such patches, should go to <a
href="mailto:libstdc++@gcc.gnu.org">libstdc++@gcc.gnu.org</a> as well
as to gcc-patches.  Patches to the Java library (libgcj) should go to
<a href="mailto:java-patches@gcc.gnu.org">java-patches@gcc.gnu.org</a>
instead of gcc-patches.</p>

<p>Everything listed here still applies if you can check in the patch
without further approval under the <a
href="cvswrite.html#policies">GCC write access policies</a>, except
that ChangeLog entries may be included as part of the patch since
no-one else will need to apply it to the tree later and diffs representing
totally new files may be omitted (especially if large) since they can be
accessed directly from the repository.</p>
