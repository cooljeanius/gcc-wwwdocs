<h1 align="center">Contributing to GCC</h1>

<p>We strongly encourage contributions of code, bugfixes, new
optimizations, new features, documentation updates, web page
improvements, etc. for GCC</p>

<p>There are certain legal requirements and style issues which all
contributions must meet.</p>

<h2>Coding Standards</h2>

  <p>All contributions must conform to the <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html">GNU Coding
  Standards</a>.  There are also some <a
  href="codingconventions.html">additional coding conventions for
  GCC</a>.  Submissions which do not conform to the standards will be
  returned with a request to reformat the changes.</p>


<h2>Copyright Assignment</h2>

<p>Before we can accept code contributions from you, we need a
copyright assignment form filled out and filed with the FSF.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain.html#SEC6">See some
documentation by the FSF</a> for details and contact us (either via
the <a href="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">gcc@gcc.gnu.org</a> list or the
GCC maintainer that is taking care of your contributions) to obtain
the relevant forms.</p>

<p>Small changes can be accepted without a copyright assignment form
on file.</p>


<h2>Submitting Patches</h2>

  <p>Every patch must have several pieces of information before we can
  properly evaluate it.

  <ul>
  <li> A description of the bug and how your patch fixes this bug.  For
       new features a description of the feature and your implementation.
  <li> If the patch adds a new command line option, the patch must
       also add documentation for that option to the GCC manual.
       Similarly, if it changes the behavior of an existing command
       line option or other documented behavior, the patch must update
       the documentation.</li>
  <li> It is strongly recommended the patch should add testcases for
       any new features added and any bugs fixed to the testsuite, if
       not already there.  (You will of course have tested any new
       features you added, so this is simply a matter of writing your
       tests in a suitable form for inclusion in the testsuite.)</li>
  <li> A ChangeLog entry as plaintext; see the various ChangeLog files
       for format and content.<br>
       Note that, unlike some other projects, we do require ChangeLogs
       also for documentation (i.e., .texi files).  They are not required
       for updates to the web pages.
  <li> A list of targets where the patch survived a bootstrap of GCC.  A
       bootstrap on least one host is required for any non-trivial change.
       A full GCC testsuite run is also required.   With your patch, provide a 
       list of hosts where the GCC testsuite was run, including an 
       analysis of any regressions.
  <li> The patch itself.  If you are accessing the <a href="cvs.html">
       CVS repository</a> at gcc.gnu.org, use 
       &quot;<code>cvs update; cvs diff -c3p</code>&quot;; else, use 
       &quot;<code>diff -c3p OLD NEW</code>&quot; or 
       &quot;<code>diff -up OLD NEW</code>&quot;.
       If your version of diff does not support these options, then get 
       the latest version of GNU diff.

  </ul>
  <p>We accept patches as plain text (preferred for the compilers
  themselves), MIME attachments (preferred for the web pages),
  or as uuencoded gzipped text.</p>

  <p>When you have all these pieces, bundle them up in a mail message and
  send it to
  <a href="mailto:gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org">gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org</a>.
  All patches and related discussion should be sent to the gcc-patches
  mailinglist.  For further information on the GCC CVS repository, see
  the <a href="cvs.html">Anonymous read-only CVS access</a> and 
  <a href="cvswrite.html">Read-write CVS access</a> pages.

  <p>If you do not receive a response to a patch that you have submitted
  within a month or so,
  it may be a good idea to chase it by sending a follow-up email to
  <a href="mailto:gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org">gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org</a>.
  Patches can occasionally fall through the cracks. Please be sure to
  include in the follow-up email the URL of the entry in the mailing list
  archive of the original submission.</p>
