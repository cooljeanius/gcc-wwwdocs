<h1 align="center">Contributing to GCC</h1>

<p>We strongly encourage contributions of code, bugfixes, new
optimizations, new features, documentation updates, web page
improvements, etc. for GCC</p>

<p>There are certain legal requirements and style issues which all
contributions must meet.</p>

<h2>Coding Standards</h2>

  <p>All contributions must conform to the <a
  href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html">GNU Coding
  Standards</a>.  There are also some <a
  href="codingconventions.html">additional coding conventions for
  GCC</a>; these include documentation and testsuite requirements as
  well as requirements on code formatting.  Submissions which do not
  conform to the standards will be returned with a request to address
  any such problems.</p>


<h2>Copyright Assignment</h2>

<p>Before we can accept code contributions from you, we need a
copyright assignment form filled out and filed with the FSF.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain.html#SEC6">See some
documentation by the FSF</a> for details and contact us (either via
the <a href="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">gcc@gcc.gnu.org</a> list or the
GCC maintainer that is taking care of your contributions) to obtain
the relevant forms. Note that it's a good idea to put
<a href="mailto:assignments@gnu.org">assignments@gnu.org</a> in copy with
your request.</p>

<p>Small changes can be accepted without a copyright assignment form
on file.</p>


<h2>Submitting Patches</h2>

<p>Every patch must have several pieces of information before we can
properly evaluate it:</p>

<dl>

<dt>A description of the problem/bug and how your patch addresses it.</dt>
<dd>
For new features a description of the feature and your implementation.
For bugs a description of what was wrong with the existing code, and a
reference to any previous bug report (in the <a href="gnats.html">GCC
GNATS database</a> or the <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/">gcc-bugs archives</a>) and any
existing testcases for the problem in the GCC testsuite.
</dd>

<dt>Testcases</dt>
<dd>
If you cannot follow the recommendations of the <a
href="codingconventions.html">GCC coding conventions</a> about
testcases, you should include a justification for why adequate
testcases cannot be added.
</dd>

<dt>ChangeLog</dt>
<dd>
A ChangeLog entry as plaintext; see the various ChangeLog files for
format and content, and the <a href="codingconventions.html">GCC
coding conventions</a> and <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_toc.html">GNU Coding
Standards</a> for further information.  The ChangeLog entries should be
plaintext rather than part of the patch since the top of the ChangeLog
changes rapidly and a patch to the ChangeLog would probably no longer
apply by the time your patch is reviewed.
</dd>

<dt>Bootstrapping and testing</dt>
<dd>
A list of targets where the patch survived a bootstrap of GCC.  A
bootstrap on at least one host is required for any non-trivial change.  A
full GCC testsuite run is also required.  With your patch, provide a
list of hosts where the GCC testsuite was run, including an analysis
of any regressions.  Documentation changes do not require a bootstrap,
but must pass <code>make info</code> and <code>make dvi</code>.
</dd>

<dt>The patch itself</dt>
<dd>
If you are accessing the <a href="cvs.html"> CVS repository</a> at
gcc.gnu.org, use &quot;<code>cvs update; cvs diff -c3p</code>&quot;;
else, use &quot;<code>diff -c3p OLD NEW</code>&quot; or
&quot;<code>diff -up OLD NEW</code>&quot;.  If your version of diff
does not support these options, then get the latest version of GNU
diff.  Patches against current development (mainline CVS) are
preferred to patches against releases, unless your patch is intended
as a candidate for the release branch.
</dd>

</dl>

  <p>Don't mix together changes made for different reasons.  Send them
  <em>individually</em>.  Ideally, each change you send should be
  impossible to subdivide into parts that we might want to consider
  separately, because each of its parts gets its motivation from the
  other parts.  In particular, changes to code formatting to conform
  to coding standards are best not mixed with substantive changes,
  because that makes it difficult to see what the real changes are.
  (In the case of a very large reorganization of code, it may make
  sense to separate changes even further to make it clearer what has
  changed; for example, by first sending structural changes that make
  subsequent changes easier but do not change GCC's behavior, then new
  code, then the changes that actually make use of the new code and
  change GCC's behavior.)</p>

  <p>We accept patches as plain text (preferred for the compilers
  themselves), MIME attachments (preferred for the web pages),
  or as uuencoded gzipped text.</p>

  <p>When you have all these pieces, bundle them up in a mail message and
  send it to
  <a href="mailto:gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org">gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org</a>.
  All patches and related discussion should be sent to the gcc-patches
  mailinglist.  For further information on the GCC CVS repository, see
  the <a href="cvs.html">Anonymous read-only CVS access</a> and 
  <a href="cvswrite.html">Read-write CVS access</a> pages.

  <p>If you do not receive a response to a patch that you have submitted
  within a month or so,
  it may be a good idea to chase it by sending a follow-up email to
  <a href="mailto:gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org">gcc-patches@gcc.gnu.org</a>.
  Patches can occasionally fall through the cracks. Please be sure to
  include the URL of the entry in the mailing list archive of the original
  submission.</p>

  <p>Patches to the standard C++ library (libstdc++-v3), and its web
  pages, and discussion of such patches, should go to <a
  href="mailto:libstdc++@gcc.gnu.org">libstdc++@gcc.gnu.org</a> as
  well as to gcc-patches.  Patches to the Java library (libgcj) should
  go to <a
  href="mailto:java-patches@gcc.gnu.org">java-patches@gcc.gnu.org</a>
  instead of gcc-patches.</p>
