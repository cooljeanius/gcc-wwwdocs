<h1>GCC 4.8 Release Series<br />Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>


<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>To enable the Graphite framework for loop optimizations you now
need CLooG version 0.17.0 and ISL version 0.10.  Both can be obtained
from the
<a href="ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/">GCC infrastructure</a>
directory.  The installation manual contains
more information about requirements to build GCC.</p>

<p>The G++ namespace association extension, <code>__attribute ((strong))</code>,
has been deprecated. Inline namespaces should be used instead.</p>

<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A new option <code>-ftree-partial-pre</code> was added to control
      the partial redundancy elimination (PRE) optimization.
      This option is enabled by default at the <code>-O3</code> optimization
      level, and it makes PRE more aggressive.
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2 id="targets">New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

<h3>IA-32/x86-64</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow <code>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</code> for the x86-64
    architecture with SSE extensions disabled.  Since the x86-64 ABI
    requires 16 byte stack alignment, this is ABI incompatible and
    intended to be used in controlled environments where stack space
    is an important limitation.
    This option will lead to wrong code when functions compiled with 16 byte
    stack alignment (such as functions from a standard library) are called
    with misaligned stack.  In this case, SSE instructions may lead to
    misaligned memory access traps.  In addition, variable arguments will
    be handled incorrectly for 16 byte aligned objects (including x87
    <code>long double</code> and <code>__int128</code>), leading to
    wrong results.  You must build all
    modules with <code>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</code>, including any
    libraries.  This includes the system libraries and startup modules.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="mips">MIPS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>GCC now passes the <code>-mmcu</code> and <code>-mno-mcu</code>
    options to the assembler.</li>
  </ul>
