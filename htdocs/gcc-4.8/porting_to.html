<h1>Porting to GCC 4.8</h1>

<p>
The GCC 4.8 release series differs from previous GCC releases in more
than the usual list of
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/changes.html">changes</a>. Some of
these are a result of bug fixing, and some old behaviors have been
intentionally changed in order to support new standards, or relaxed
in standards-conforming ways to facilitate compilation or runtime
performance.  Some of these changes are not visible to the naked eye
and will not cause problems when updating from older versions.
</p>

<p>
However, some of these changes are visible, and can cause grief to
users porting to GCC 4.8. This document is an effort to identify major
issues and provide clear solutions in a quick and easily searched
manner. Additions and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
</p>

<h2>General issues</h2>

<h3>New warnings</h3>

<p>Improvements to the GCC infrastructure allow improvements in
the ability of several existing warnings to spot problematic code. As
such, new warnings may exist for previously warning-free code that
uses
<code>-Wmaybe-uninitialized</code>.
</p>

<p> Although these warnings will
not result in compilation failure, often <code>-Wall</code> is used in
conjunction with <code>-Werror</code> and as a result, new warnings
are turned into new errors.
</p>

<p>As a workaround, remove <code>-Werror</code> until the new warnings
are fixed, or add <code>-Wno-maybe-uninitialized</code>.
</p>

<h3>More aggressive loop optimizations</h3>

<p>Improvements to the GCC infrastructure allow improvements in
the ability of the optimizers to transform loops. Some loops that previously
invoked undefined behavior may now be turned into endless loops.
</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre>
unsigned int foo()
{
  unsigned int data_data[128];
  
  for (int fd = 0; fd < 128; ++fd)
    data_data[fd] = fd * (0x02000001); // error

  return data_data[0];
}
</pre>

<p>
When fd is 64 or above, fd * 0x02000001 overflows, which is invalid in C/C++ for signed ints.  
</p>

<p>
To fix, use the appropriate casts when converting between signed and
unsigned types to avoid overflows. Like so:
</p>

<pre>
    data_data[fd] = (uint32_t) fd * (0x02000001U); // ok
</pre>

<h2>C language issues</h2>

<h3>New warnings for pointer access</h3>

<p>
The behavior of <code>-Wall</code> has changed and now includes the
new warning flag <code>-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess</code>. This may
result in new warnings in code that compiled cleanly with previous
versions of GCC.
</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre>
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

struct A { };

int main(void) 
{
  A obj;
  A* p1 = &obj;
  A p2[10];

  memset(p1, 0, sizeof(p1)); // error
  memset(p1, 0, sizeof(*p1)); // ok, dereferenced
  memset(p2, 0, sizeof(p2)); // ok, array

  return 0;
}
</pre>

<p>Gives the following diagnostic:</p>
<pre>
warning: argument to ‘sizeof’ in ‘void* memset(void*, int, size_t)’ call is the same expression as the destination; did you mean to dereference it? [-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess]
  memset(p1, 0, sizeof(p1)); // error
                       ^
</pre>

<p>Although these warnings will not result in compilation failure,
often <code>-Wall</code> is used in conjunction with
<code>-Werror</code> and as a result, new warnings are turned into
new errors.</p>
 
<p>To fix, either re-write to use memcpy or dereference the last argument in the
offending memset call.</p>
 
<p>As a workaround, use
<code>-Wno-sizeof-pointer-memaccess</code>.

<h3>Pre-processor pre-includes</h3>

<p>
The GCC pre-processor may now pre-includes a file that defines certain
macros for the entirety of the translation unit. This allows
fully conformant implementations of C99/C11 and other standards that
require compiler or compiler + runtime macros that describe
implementation availability.
</p>

<p>
On linux, &lt;stdc-predef.h&gt; is pre-included.
</p>

<p>
This subtle change means that some more creative uses of the
pre-processor may now fail, with the following diagnostic:
</p>

<pre>
/usr/include/stdc-predef.h:0: error: Syntax error near '3' 
</pre>

<p>As a workaround, the stdc-predef.h preinclude can be disabled with
the use of <code>-ffreestanding</code>. For non C/C++ code, use the pre-processor flag <code>-P</code>. 


<h2>C++ language issues</h2>

<h3>New warnings for unused local typedefs</h3>

<p>
The behavior of <code>-Wall</code> has changed and now includes the
new warning flag <code>-Wunused-local-typedefs</code>. This may
result in new warnings in code that compiled cleanly with previous
versions of GCC.
</p>

<p>For example,</p>
<pre>
template<typename _Tp>
  int
  foo(_Tp __a)
  {
    typedef int return_type;
    return 5;
  }

int i = foo(415);
</pre>

<p>Gives the following diagnostic:</p>
<pre>
warning: typedef ‘return_type’ locally defined but not used [-Wunused-local-typedefs]
     typedef int return_type;
                 ^
</pre>

<p>Although these warnings will not result in compilation failure,
often <code>-Wall</code> is used in conjunction with
<code>-Werror</code> and as a result, new warnings are turned into
new errors.</p>
 
<p>To fix, simply remove the unused typedef.</p>
 
<p>As a workaround, use
<code>-Wno-unused-local-typedefs</code>.

<h3>Stray comma at the end of declaration now rejected</h3>

<p>
GCC by default no longer accepts code such as
</p>

<pre>
struct A { struct B *C,; };
</pre>

<p>This example now gives the following diagnostic:</p>
<pre>
error: stray ‘,’ at end of member declaration
 struct A { struct B *C,; };
                       ^
</pre>

<p>To fix, simply remove the unused comma.</p>
