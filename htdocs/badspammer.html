<h1>Spambot detected.</h1>

<p>
Hi, our server has decided that you are, in fact, not a human being,
but rather a sinister computer program designed to scoop up email
addresses and bombard them with unsolicited advertisements.

<p>
Now, since we find that kind of conduct reprehensible, we have decided
to deny you access to our site. Hey, you're lucky we didn't launch
nuclear missiles at you.

<p>
If we made a mistake, and you really are a human being, we apologize
profusely. It just happens that your browser looks VERY similar to
a known spambot. Try using a different browser and you should have no
problem connecting to the site.

<p>
Have a good day (and die, spambots, die)
