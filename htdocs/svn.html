<h1>GCC: Anonymous read-only SVN access</h1>

<p>Our SVN source repository is available read-only to the public at
large.  That way you can pick up any version (including releases) of
GCC that is in our repository.</p>

<p>Our web pages are still maintained via CVS, and can be accessed
using the directions for <a href="cvs.html">our CVS setup</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, you can browse our SVN history online at</p>

<ul>
<!-- Commented out till savannah gets back to us (see below)
  <li><a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/gcc/">savannah.gnu.org</a>
  using viewcvs, or</li> -->
  <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/">gcc.gnu.org</a>
      using ViewVC.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Using the SVN repository</h2>

<p>Assuming you have version 1.0.0 and higher of
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> installed, you can
check out the GCC sources using the following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>svn checkout svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk SomeLocalDir</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are behind a firewall that does not allow the svn protocol
through, you can replace <code>svn://</code> with <code>http://</code>.
You may also need to modify your subversion servers file
(~/.subversion/servers) to set <code>http-proxy-host</code> and
<code>http-proxy-port</code>.  You should only use the http protocol if
the svn protocol does not work; the http protocol has a higher server
overhead associated with it and will be slower.</p>

<p>There is more <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/SvnHelp">information
about Subversion specifically for GCC</a> in the GCC Wiki.</p>

<h3 id="generated_files">Generated files</h3>

<p>Our source tree contains a number of files that are generated
from other source files by build tools such as Bison, Autoconf, and
Gperf.  Bison is now required when using SVN to access our sources,
but all other generated files are included in the source tree so that
GCC can be built without these build tools. The SVN checkout and
update operations do not insure that the timestamps of generated files
are later than those of the files they are generated from.  The script
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code> updates the timestamps for all these
generated files.  See the comments in that script for instructions on
running it.</p>

<p>GCC's build system (in particular Make) uses file timestamps to
determine if a generated file needs to be updated by running a particular
build tool.  Because of this, GCC's build system may believe that
a generated file needs regenerating even though its source has not
changed, and require a particular build tool to rebuild that generated
file.  If the appropriate build tool is installed on your system, then
this will not be a problem.  If you do not intend to make changes to
the source, you can avoid installing these build tools by running
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code>.</p>

<p>There has been some discussion of removing these generated files
from GCC's SVN source tree (there is no discussion of removing them
from the released source tarballs).  If that happens then
building GCC from the SVN source tree would require installing
the above mentioned build tools.  Installing these build tools is not
particularly difficult, but can be time consuming especially if you
only occasionally install GCC on a particular system.</p>

<p>The build tools that GCC uses are all available from the GNU
Project (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a>),
are often already available on many  systems, and can often be found
already built for some systems.  A partial list of these build tools
is: Autoconf, Bison, Xgettext, Automake, and Gperf.</p>

<h3>Conflicts when using <code>svn update</code></h3>

<p>It is not uncommon to get svn conflict messages for some generated files
when updating your local sources from the SVN repository.  Typically such
conflicts occur with autoconf generated files.</p>

<p>As long as you haven't been making modifications to the generated files
or the generator files, it is safe to delete the offending file, then run
<code>svn update</code> again to get a new copy.</p>


<h2 id="tags">Branches and Tags</h2>

<p> A branch called <em>branchname</em> can be checked out with the
following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>svn co svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/branches/<em>branchname</em> gcc</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p> Similarly a tag called <em>tagname</em> can be checked out with the
following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>svn co svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/tags/<em>tagname</em> gcc</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p> The release branch of the latest version of GCC
<em>x</em>.<em>y</em> is named
<code>gcc-<em>x</em>_<em>y</em>-branch</code>. For recent releases,
the SVN tag for GCC <i>X</i>.<i>Y</i>.<i>Z</i> is of the form
<code>gcc_<em>X</em>_<em>Y</em>_<em>Z</em>_release</code>.
The following list provides only some representative
examples.</p>

<ul>
  <li>gcc_3_4_3_release</li>
  <li>gcc_3_4_2_release</li>
  <li>gcc_3_4_1_release</li>

<h4>General Infrastructure</h4>

<dl>

  <dt><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Var_Tracking_Assignments">
      var-tracking-assignments-branch</a></dt>
  <dd>This branch aims at improving debug information by annotating
  assignments early in the compilation, and carrying over such
  annotations throughout optimization passes and representations.
  This branch is maintained by Alexandre Oliva.  This branch is
  now tracking GCC 4.4; a separate 4.3 branch was maintained for some
  time, but there are no plans to maintain it any further.</dd>

  <dt>struct-reorg-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch is for the development of structure reorganization
  optimizations, including field reordering, structure splitting for
  trees.  These optimizations are profile information driven.  This is
  a subbranch of tree-profiling.  This branch is being maintained by
  Caroline Tice, Dale Johannesen, Kenneth Zadeck, Stuart Hastings,
  Mostafa Hagog.</dd>

  <dt>autovect-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch is the successor to the lno-branch.  The purpose of this
  branch is tree-level <a href="projects/tree-ssa/vectorization.html">
  autovectorization</a> work, and related work that the autovectorizer
  could use or benefit from (like data-dependence analysis,
  <a href="projects/tree-ssa/lno.html">loop nest optimizations</a>).</dd>

  <dt><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Graphite">graphite-branch</a></dt>
  <dd>The purpose of this branch is to develop an infrastructure for loop
  transforms using the polyhedral model.</dd>

  <dt><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/LinkTimeOptimization">lto</a></dt>
  <dd>This branch aims to implement link-time optimization.  Patches
  and discussion on this branch should be marked with the tag
  <code>[lto]</code> in the subject line.</dd>

  <dt>boehms-gc</dt>
  <dd>The goal of this branch is to test Boehm's GC feasibility as the
  garbage collector for GCC proper.  This is a part of Google Summer
  of Code project, described in detail
  at <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_tuning">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_tuning</a>.  The
  branch is maintained
  by <a href="mailto:laurynas.biveinis@gmail.com">Laurynas
  Biveinis</a>.</dd>

  <dt>ra-improvements</dt>
  <dd>This branch aims to implement several improvements to the
  current register allocator.  Examples include implenting a 
  lower-triangular conflict matrix and register coalescing.
  It is hoped that these improvements will not only help the
  current allocator, but will be useful to the other register
  allocation projects such as RABLE and YARA. This branch will
  be merged with the dataflow-branch from time to time.
  The patches for this branch should be marked with the tag
  <code>[ra-improvements]</code> in the subject line.  The branch
  is maintained by <a href="mailto:bergner@vnet.ibm.com">Peter
  Bergner</a>.</dd>

  <dt>ira</dt>
  <dd>This branch contains the Integrated Register Allocator (IRA).  It is
  based on work done on yara-branch.  The latter is more of a research
  branch because one of its goals (removing reload) is too remote.  The
  ira branch is focused to prepare some code for GCC mainline, hopefully
  in time for GCC 4.4.  IRA still uses reload; it is called integrated
  because register coalescing and register live range splitting are done
  on-the-fly during coloring.  The branch is maintained by Vladimir
  Makarov &lt; <a
  href="mailto:vmakarov@redhat.com">vmakarov@redhat.com</a>&gt; and
  will be merged with mainline from time to time.  Patches will be
  marked with the tag <code>[ira]</code> in the subject line.</dd>

  <dt>ira-merge</dt>
  <dd>This branch contains bug fixes for the Integrated Register Allocator
  (IRA).  It is branched from trunk at revision 139590 when IRA was
  merged into trunk.  It is used to track IRA related regressions.
  Only IRA fixes from trunk will be applied to this branch. Its goal is
  there should be no "make check"  and performance regressions against
  trunk at revision 139589.  The branch is maintained by H.J. Lu &lt;<a
  href="mailto:hjl.tools@gmail.com">hjl.tools@gmail.com</a>&gt; and
  Vladimir Makarov &lt;
  <a href="mailto:vmakarov@redhat.com">vmakarov@redhat.com</a>&gt;.</dd>

  <dt>sel-sched-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch contains the implementation of the selective scheduling
  approach.  The goal of the branch is to provide more aggressive scheduler 
  implementation with support for instruction cloning, register renaming,
  and forward substitution.   The branch is maintained by Andrey
  Belevantsev &lt;<a href="mailto:abel@ispras.ru">abel@ispras.ru</a>&gt; 
  and Maxim Kuvyrkov &lt;<a href="mailto:mkuvyrkov@ispras.ru">

  <dd>This branch contains change to turn GCC into an incremental
  compiler.  The branch is maintained by Tom
  Tromey <a href="mailto:tromey@redhat.com">tromey@redhat.com</a>.
  Patches for this branch should be marked with the
  tag <code>[incremental]</code> in the subject line.
  </dd>

  <dt>gc-improv</dt>

  <dt>insn-select</dt>
  <dd>This branch aimed to implement in early instruction selection
  and register class selection pass, which runs before register allocation
  and subsumes the current <code>regclass</code> pass.  In particular
  the goal is to chose an alternative per instruction, usable as a base
  during register allocation, which ideally is not changed during reload
  if registers could be allocated.  This will not be possible in all cases,
  especially when addresses generated during spilling will be invalid on
  the target machine.  But we should be able to do away with fake register
  classes representing strict unions of other register classes.  The
  branch was maintained by Michael Matz.  It is no longer
  maintained.</dd>
  
  <dt>addressing-modes</dt>
  <dd>This branch aimed to clean up the way base and index registers are
