<h1>GCC: Anonymous read-only SVN access</h1>

<p>Our SVN source repository is available read-only to the public at
large.</p>

<p>That way you can pick up any version (including releases) of GCC that
is in our repository or our <a href="cvs.html#wwwdocs">web pages</a>.</p>

<p> Web pages are still stored in CVS, and thus, should be accessed
using the directions for <a href="cvs.html">CVS</a></p>

<p>In addition, you can browse our SVN history online at</p>

<ul>
<!-- Commented out till savannah gets back to us (see below)
  <li><a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/gcc/">savannah.gnu.org</a>
  using viewcvs, or</li> -->
  <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs/">gcc.gnu.org</a>
      using ViewVC.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Using the SVN repository</h2>

<p>Assuming you have version 1.0.0 and higher of
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> installed, you can
check out the GCC sources using the following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>svn -q checkout svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk gcc</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>(The option <code>-q</code> above is optional and instructs SVN to
print as little as possible.  You can abbreviate <code>checkout</code>
as <code>co</code>.  Instead of <code>gcc</code> you can specify any
other local directory name to receive the GCC sources.)</p>

<p>If you are behind a firewall that does not allow the svn protocol
through, you can replace <code>svn://</code> with <code>http://</code>.
You may also need to modify your subversion servers file
(~/.subversion/servers) to set <code>http-proxy-host</code> and
<code>http-proxy-port</code>.  You should only use the http protocol if
the svn protocol does not work; the http protocol has a higher server
overhead associated with it and will be slower.</p>

<h3><a name="generated_files"></a>Generated files</h3>

<p>Our source tree contains a number of files that are generated
from other source files by build tools such as Bison, Autoconf, and
Gperf.  Bison is now required when using SVN to access our sources,
but all other generated files are included in the source tree so that
GCC can be built without these build tools. The SVN checkout and
update operations do not insure that the timestamps of generated files
are later than those of the files they are generated from.  The script
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code> updates the timestamps for all these
generated files.  See the comments in that script for instructions on
running it.</p>

<p>GCC's build system (in particular Make) uses file timestamps to
determine if a generated file needs to be updated by running a particular
build tool.  Because of this, GCC's build system may believe that
a generated file needs regenerating even though its source has not
changed, and require a particular build tool to rebuild that generated
file.  If the appropriate build tool is installed on your system, then
this will not be a problem.  If you do not intend to make changes to
the source, you can avoid installing these build tools by running
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code>.</p>

<p>There has been some discussion of removing these generated files
from GCC's SVN source tree (there is no discussion of removing them
from the released source tarballs).  If that happens then
building GCC from the SVN source tree would require installing
the above mentioned build tools.  Installing these build tools is not
particularly difficult, but can be time consuming especially if you
only occasionally install GCC on a particular system.</p>

<p>The build tools that GCC uses are all available from the GNU
Project (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a>),
are often already available on many  systems, and can often be found
already built for some systems.  A partial list of these build tools
is: Autoconf, Bison, Xgettext, Automake, and Gperf.</p>

<h3>Conflicts when using <code>svn update</code></h3>

<p>It is not uncommon to get svn conflict messages for some generated files
when updating your local sources from the SVN repository.  Typically such
conflicts occur with autoconf generated files.</p>

<p>As long as you haven't been making modifications to the generated files
or the generator files, it is safe to delete the offending file, then run
<code>svn update</code> again to get a new copy.</p>


<h2 id="tags">SVN tags, branches and checkouts</h2>

<p> You can check out the latest version of the GCC <em>x</em>.<em>y</em>
release branch with the following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>svn co svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/branches/gcc-<em>x</em>_<em>y</em>-branch gcc</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>By changing the <code>gcc-<em>x</em>_<em>y</em>-branch</code> part
of the URL, you can check out particular releases or branches.</p>

<h3>Release and branches</h3>

<p>For recent releases, the SVN tag for GCC <i>X</i>.<i>Y</i>.<i>Z</i> is
of the form "gcc_<i>X</i>_<i>Y</i>_<i>Z</i>_release":</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>svn co svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/tags/gcc_<em>x</em>_<em>y</em>_<em>z</em>_release gcc</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The SVN branch for GCC releases in the <i>X</i>.<i>Y</i> series is
generally of the form "gcc-<i>X</i>_<i>Y</i>-branch".  The following
list therefore provides only some representative examples.</p>

<ul>
  <li>gcc_3_4_3_release</li>
  <li>gcc_3_4_2_release</li>
  <li>gcc_3_4_1_release</li>
  <li>gcc_3_4_0_release</li>
  <li>gcc-3_4-branch</li>
  <li>egcs_1_1_2_release</li>

<h4>General Infrastructure</h4>

<dl>

  <dt><a href="projects/tree-profiling.html">tree-profiling-branch</a></dt>
  <dd>This branch is for the development of profiling heuristics
  and profile based optimizations for trees, such as profile driven inline
  heuristics.  Another goal of this branch is to demonstrate that maintaining
  the CFG and profile information over expanding from GIMPLE trees to RTL
  is feasible and can bring considerable performance improvements.</dd>

  <dt>struct-reorg-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch is for the development of structure reorganization
  optimizations, including field reordering, structure splitting for
  trees.  These optimizations are profile information driven.  This is
  a subbranch of tree-profiling.  This branch is being maintained by
  Caroline Tice, Dale Johannesen, Kenneth Zadeck, Stuart Hastings,
  Mostafa Hagog.</dd>


  <dt>autovect-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch is the successor to the lno-branch.  The purpose of this
  branch is tree-level <a href="projects/tree-ssa/vectorization.html">
  autovectorization</a> work, and related work that the autovectorizer
  could use or benefit from (like data-dependence analysis,
  <a href="projects/tree-ssa/lno.html">loop nest optimizations</a>).</dd>

  <dt>new-regalloc-branch</dt>
  <dd>Daniel Berlin and Michael Matz are working on an implementation
  of a graph-coloring register allocator on this branch. It is known to
  bootstrap under x86-linux-gnu and ppc-linux-gnu.</dd>
 
  <dt>structure-aliasing-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch contains improvements to the tree optimizers ability 
  to do pointer-to-structure aliasing analysis and optimization.  
  This involves some significant rework of the way
  our memory information is represented in the tree-ssa form.
  The branch is maintained by Daniel Berlin.
  Patches and discussion related to the branch should be marked
  with the tag <code>[sa]</code> in the subject line.  The usual
  contribution and testing rules apply.  Patches should be CC'd
  to Daniel Berlin for final approval.</dd>

  <dt><a href="projects/cfo.html">cfo-branch</a></dt>
  <dd>The goal of this branch is to add a new extension for improving
  the code size optimization of GCC with code factoring methods (code
  motion and merging algorithms). Messages should be marked with 
  <code>[cfo]</code> in the subject line. The usual contribution and 
  testing rules apply.</dd>

  <dt>reload-branch</dt>

  of reload register lifetimes and the inheritance code has been
  rewritten in an attempt to make it more maintainable.</dd>
  
  <dt>improved-aliasing-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch contains improvements to the tree-based aliasing
  infrastructure.  The branch is maintained by Daniel Berlin &lt;<a
  href="mailto:dberlin@dberlin.org">dberlin@dberlin.org</a>&gt; and
  Diego Novillo &lt;<a href="mailto:dnovillo@redhat.com">
    dnovillo@redhat.com</a>&gt; and will be routinely merged with

  <dd>This branch is for the development of a treegion-based instruction 
  scheduler.  The branch is maintained by Chad Rosier.
  </dd>

  <dt>mem-ssa</dt>
  <dd>This branch contains the implementation of Memory SSA, a new
  mechanism for representing memory operations in SSA form (<a
  href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2006-02/msg00620.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2006-02/msg00620.html</a>).
  The branch is maintained by Diego Novillo and will be routinely
  merged with mainline.  Patches and discussion on this branch should
  be marked with the tag <code>[mem-ssa]</code> in the subject
  line.</dd>

  <dt>gimple-tuples-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch contains the implementation of GIMPLE tuples, a new
  representation for GIMPLE statements and expressions that replaces the
  current notion of treating everything as a tree
  (<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/tuples">
  http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/tuples</a>).
  This branch is maintained by Aldy Hernandez and will be routinely merged
  with mainline.  Patches and discussion on this branch should be marked with
  the tag <code>[tuples]</code> in the subject line.</dd>

  <dt>yara-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch contains Yet Another Register Allocator (YARA).
  The branch is maintained by Vladimir Makarov &lt;
  <a href="mailto:vmakarov@redhat.com">vmakarov@redhat.com</a>&gt;
  and will be merged with mainline from time to time.  Patches
  will be marked with the tag
  <code>[yara-branch]</code> in the subject line.</dd>

  <dt>opt-diary</dt>
  <dd>This branch contains the implementation of Optimization Diary, 
  a collection of useful log information generated by the optimizers. 
  This branch is maintained by Devang Patel. Patches and discussion 
  on this branch should be marked with the tag

  <dt>boehms-gc</dt>
  <dd>The goal of this branch is to test Boehm's GC feasibility as the
  garbage collector for GCC proper.  This is a part of Google Summer
  of Code project, described in detail
  at <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Garbage%20collection%20tuning">http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Garbage%20collection%20tuning</a>.  The
  branch is maintained
  by <a href="mailto:laurynas.biveinis@gmail.com">Laurynas
  Biveinis</a>.</dd>

  <dt>ra-improvements</dt>
  <dd>This branch aims to implement several improvements to the
  current register allocator.  Examples include implenting a 
  lower-triangular conflict matrix and register coalescing.
  It is hoped that these improvements will not only help the
  current allocator, but will be useful to the other register
  allocation projects such as RABLE and YARA. This branch will
  be merged with the dataflow-branch from time to time.
  The patches for this branch should be marked with the tag
  <code>[ra-improvements]</code> in the subject line.  The branch
  is maintained by <a href="mailto:bergner@vnet.ibm.com">Peter
  Bergner</a>.</dd>

  <dt>insn-select</dt>
  <dd>This branch aims to implement in early instruction selection
  and register class selection pass, which runs before register allocation
  and subsumes the current <code>regclass</code> pass.  In particular
  the goal is to chose an alternative per instruction, usable as a base
  during register allocation, which ideally is not changed during reload
  if registers could be allocated.  This will not be possible in all cases,
  especially when addresses generated during spilling will be invalid on
  the target machine.  But we should be able to do away with fake register
  classes representing strict unions of other register classes.  Patches
  should be marked with <code>[isel]</code> or <code>[insn-select]</code>
  in the subject line.  The branch is maintained by Michael Matz.</dd>

  <dt>addressing-modes</dt>
  <dd>This branch aims to clean up the way base and index registers are
  handled by target headers.  In particular, the strict and non-strict
  meaning of these registers are unified and a common API is presented to
  implementations of the target macros.  Obsolete target macros will also
  be removed.  Patches should be marked with <code>[addrmodes]</code> in
  the subject line, and only need approval (from Paolo Bonzini) if they may
  change the compiler output.  The branch is maintained by Paolo Bonzini.</dd>

  <dt>ira</dt>
  <dd>This branch contains the Integrated Register Allocator (IRA).  It is
  based on work done on yara-branch.  The latter is more of a research
  branch because one of its goals (removing reload) is too remote.  The
  ira branch is focused to prepare some code for GCC mainline, hopefully
  in time for GCC 4.4.  IRA still uses reload; it is called integrated
  because register coalescing and register live range splitting are done
  on-the-fly during coloring.  The branch is maintained by Vladimir
  Makarov &lt; <a
  href="mailto:vmakarov@redhat.com">vmakarov@redhat.com</a>&gt; and
  will be merged with mainline from time to time.  Patches will be
  marked with the tag <code>[ira]</code> in the subject line.</dd>

  <dt>sel-sched-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch contains the implementation of the selective scheduling
  approach.  The goal of the branch is to provide more aggressive scheduler 
  implementation with support for instruction cloning, register renaming,
  and forward substitution.   The branch is maintained by Andrey
  Belevantsev &lt;<a href="mailto:abel@ispras.ru">abel@ispras.ru</a>&gt; 
  and Maxim Kuvyrkov &lt;<a href="mailto:mkuvyrkov@ispras.ru">

  <dt>gomp-01-branch</dt>
  <dt>gomp-branch</dt>
  <dd>These two branches were initial attempts to implement
  OpenMP support in GCC.  They were never properly maintained and
  have now been superceded by <code>gomp-20050608-branch</code>.</dd>

  <dt><a href="projects/tree-ssa/lno.html">lno-branch</a></dt>
  <dd>A sub-branch of tree-ssa that aims at implementing a loop
  nest optimizer at the tree level.  Was largely merged into mainline,
  and is currently unmaintained.
  This work now continues on the autovect-branch.</dd>

  <dt>java-gui-branch</dt>
  <dd>This was a temporary branch for development of java GUI libraries
  (AWT and Swing) in the libjava directory.  It has been superseded

  ABI bugs in the HP-UX C++ compiler.  It is now unmaintained.</dd>

  <dt>tree-cleanup-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch contained improvements and reorganization to the
  tree optimizers that were not ready in time for GCC 4.0.  The
  goal was to cleanup the tree optimizers and improve the sequencing
  of the passes.  It has now been merged into mainline for the
  4.1 release.</dd>

  <dt>bje-unsw-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch was dedicated to some research work by Ben Elliston
    at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) on transformation
    phase ordering.  It will never merge with mainline, although a
    selection of patches may be submitted over time.</dd>

  <dt>redhat/gcc-3_3-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch used to hold Red Hat GNU/Linux compilers based on

  and test infrastructure for CFG based code improving transformations on
  RTL.</dd>

  <dt>killloop-branch</dt>
  <dd>The missing optimizations and optimization improvements necessary
  for removing the old loop optimizer were developed on this branch.
  Most of these changes were merged in 4.2.</dd>

  <dt>ssaupdate-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch served to clean up and improve utilities for the SSA
  form updating, as well as for related changes of the SSA form
  representation.  Most of the changes in this branch were never merged.
  Part of them were incorporated in Diego Novillo's SSA updating
  improvement patch.</dd>

  <dt>predcom</dt>
  <dd>This branch aimed to implement predictive commoning optimization
  and to introduce the changes to the representation of Fortran arrays,
  alias analysis and dependency analysis to make it useful for
  the common applications (e.g., mgrid).  The branch was merged
  in 4.3.</dd>

  <dt>dataflow-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch has been merged into mainline on June 6, 2007
  as svn revsion 125624.  It used to contain replacement of backend
