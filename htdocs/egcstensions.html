<h1 align="center">egcs extensions</h1>


<p>This is a list of (experimental) extensions to egcs which, for one
reason or the other, did not (yet) make it into the official source
tree. Please direct feedback and bugreports to their respective
maintainers, not our mailing lists.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.goof.com/pcg/index.html">PentiumGCC</a></h2>
<p>The PentiumGCC (short PGCC) is an extension of egcs specifically
aimed at the newer Intel chips and their clones (Pentium, PPro,
Pentium-II and the Cyrix6x86 and AMD-K6+ chips). The current goal is
to enhance egcs to a point where it generates code as fast as PGCC,
but until that work is finished PGCC is still maintained, and often
achieves substantial speed improvements over egcs and gcc.</p>

<h2><a href="http://medo.fov.uni-mb.si/mapp/uTools/">ATMEL AVR port</a></h2>
<p>This is an experimental port for the 8bit ATMEL AVR micro
controllers.</p>

<h2><a name="sun-make">Patch to build elsewhere than in the source
directory using Sun make</a></h2>

<p>Contact: <a href="mailto:hp@axis.se">hp@axis.se</a></p>

<p>By means of a <a href="ftp://ftp.axis.se/pub/users/hp/gcc/gcc-2.95.1-sun-make-patch1.txt">patch for GCC 2.95.1</a> Sun make should be able to bootstrap
the compiler even when using Sun make, which is not sufficiently standards
compliant, for a <i>srcdir</i> != <i>objdir</i> setup.</p>

<p>Apply it with (for example) GNU patch:
<blockquote><code>
patch -p1 -d <i>/path/to/gcc-2.95.1</i> &lt;
gcc-2.95.1-sun-make-patch1.txt
</code></blockquote>
This patch is not supposed to interfere with proper building and
installation on non-Sun systems or when using GNU make.</p>
