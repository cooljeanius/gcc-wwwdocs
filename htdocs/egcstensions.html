<h1 align="center">egcs extensions</h1>


<p>This is a list of (experimental) extensions to egcs which, for one
reason or the other, did not (yet) make it into the official source
tree. Please direct feedback and bugreports to their respective
maintainers, not our mailing lists.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.gcc.ml.org/">PentiumGCC</a></h2>
<p>The PentiumGCC (short PGCC) is an extension of egcs specifically
aimed at the newer Intel chips and their clones (Pentium, PPro,
Pentium-II and the Cyrix6x86 and AMD-K6+ chips). The current goal is
to enhance egcs to a point where it generates code as fast as PGCC,
but until that work is finished PGCC is still maintained, and often
achieves substantial speed improvements over egcs and gcc.</p>

<h2><a href="http://medo.fov.uni-mb.si/mapp/uTools/">ATMEL AVR port</a></h2>
<p>This is a experimental egcs port for the 8bit ATMEL AVR micro
controllers.</p>
