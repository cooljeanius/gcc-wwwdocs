<title>GNU Fortran 95 -- Free number crunching FORALL!</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Welcome to the home of<br />GNU Fortran 95</h1>

<p>The GNU Fortran 95 project, or gfortran, is developing a Fortran 95
compiler front end, as well as runtime libraries, for 
GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection.  Gfortran development is a part of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a>, aiming to bring free
number crunching to all GNU system variants.
The gfortran development effort uses an open development environment in
order to attract a larger team of developers and to ensure that gfortran can
work on multiple architectures and diverse environments.</p>

<p>In particular, the project wishes to reach the users of the
Fortran 95 language, be it in the scientific community, in education
or in a commercial environment.  Today, truly free Fortran 90 or
Fortran 95 compilers do not exist.  We are trying to make one
available to the Fortran community.</p>

<p>You can reach us at the
<a href="mailto:fortran@gcc.gnu.org">fortran@gcc.gnu.org</a>
mailing list; for details please refer to our
<a href="../lists.html">mailing lists page</a>.</p>

<h2>Project goal</h2>
<p>We strive to provide a high quality release, which we want to work
well on a variety of native targets.  Although we
believe we cannot make the best Fortran 95 compiler for any given target,
we want gfortran to be adequate.</p>

<p>The focus is on conformance to the Fortran 95 standard and on good
performance of the executables produced by the compiler.  Secondary goals
include reasonable compile speed, a small memory foot print, and the ability
to build a cross-compiler.</p>

<p>We expect to provide the following
<a href="extensions.html">language extensions</a>.</p>

<h2>Status of compiler and run time library</h2>
<p>We regularly update the status of the
<a href="compilerstatus.html">front end development</a> and the status
of the <a href="librarystatus.html">run time library development</a>.
We also keep a <a href="todo.html">TODO list</a>.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>We encourage everyone to <a href="../contribute.html">contribute changes</a>
and help test gfortran.  Gfortran is developed on the so-called "tree-ssa"
branch of GCC.
We provide read access to our development sources for everybody with
<a href="../projects/tree-ssa/">anonymous CVS</a>.
Daily snapshots of the branch are also <a
href="http://people.redhat.com/dnovillo/pub/tree-ssa/snapshot/">
available</a>.</p>

<h2>Binaries</h2>
<p>The GNU project is about providing source code for its programs.
Sometimes, however, it is easier to install a binary directly.
<a href="http://www.gfortran.org/">Bud Davis' gfortran site</a>
offers daily binaries of gfortran for some popular architecture/operating system
combinations.  In accordance with the GPL, it also offers the corresponding
source code.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Here is a short <a href="usage.html">explanation</a> on how to invoke and
use the compiler once you have built it (or downloaded the binary).</p>

<h2>Suggested reading</h2>
<p>We provide links to some <a href="../readings.html#fortran">information</a>
relevant to Fortran programmers.</p>
