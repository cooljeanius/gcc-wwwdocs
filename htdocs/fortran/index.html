<title>GNU Fortran 95 -- Free number crunching FORALL!</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Welcome to the home of<br />GNU Fortran 95</h1>

<p>The GNU Fortran 95 project, or gfortran, is developing a Fortran 95
compiler front end, as well as runtime libraries, for 
GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection.  Gfortran development is a part of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a>, aiming to bring free
number crunching to all GNU system variants.
The gfortran development effort uses an open development environment in
order to attract a larger team of developers and to ensure that gfortran can
work on multiple architectures and diverse environments.</p>

<p>In particular, the project wishes to reach the users of the
Fortran 95 language, be it in the scientific community, in education
or in a commercial environment.  Today, truly free Fortran 90 or
Fortran 95 compilers do not exist.  We are trying to make one
available to the Fortran community.</p>

<p>You can reach us at the
<a href="mailto:fortran@gcc.gnu.org">fortran@gcc.gnu.org</a>
mailing list; for details please refer to our
<a href="../lists.html">mailing lists page</a>.</p>

<h2>Project goal</h2>
<p>We strive to provide a high quality release, which we want to work
well on a variety of native targets.  Although we
believe we cannot make the best Fortran 95 compiler for any given target,
we want gfortran to be adequate.</p>

<p>The focus is on conformance to the Fortran 95 standard and on good
performance of the executables produced by the compiler.  Secondary goals
include reasonable compile speed, a small memory foot print, and the ability
to build a cross-compiler.</p>

<p>We expect to provide the following
<a href="extensions.html">language extensions</a>.</p>

<h2>Status of compiler and run time library</h2>
<p>We regularly update the status of the
<a href="compilerstatus.html">front end development</a> and the status
of the <a href="librarystatus.html">run time library development</a>.
We also keep a <a href="todo.html">TODO list</a>.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>We encourage everyone to <a href="../contribute.html">contribute changes</a>
and help test gfortran.  Gfortran is developed on the mainline of GCC, and will
officially be released with the 4.0.0 release of the compiler collection.
We provide read access to our development sources for everybody with
<a href="../cvs.html">anonymous CVS</a>. If you do not have CVS access (for
instance because you are behind a firewall prohibiting the CVS protocol),
you might want to download <a href="../snapshots.html">snapshots</a>.</p>
<p>Contributions will be reviewed by the following people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul Brook</li>
<li>Steven Bosscher</li>
<li>Toon Moene</li>
<li>Tobias Schlueter</li>
<li>Bud Davis</li>
<li>Janne Blomqvist</li>
<li>Steve Kargl</li>
</ul>
<p>under the rules specified below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul Brook and Steven Bosscher can unilaterally commit patches they
deem reasonable, as they have set up the gfortran tree in GCC.</li>
<li>All <a href="../contribute.html">normal requirements</a> for patch
submission (assignment of copyright to the FSF, testing, changelog entries,
etc) still apply, and reviewers should ensure that these have been met
before approving changes.</li>
<li>Approval should be necessary for patches which don't fall under the
obvious rule, so with this list put in place everybody (except maintainers)
should <strong>still</strong> seek approval for his/her patches.</li>
<li>Patches should only be reviewed by people who know the affected parts
of the compiler.  I.e. the reviewer has to be sure he/she knows stuff well
enough to make a good judgement.</li>
<li>Large/complicated patches should still go by one of our maintainers.</li>
<li>We are all reasonable people, and nobody is working under employer
pressure or needs an ego-boost badly, so in general we assume that noone
deliberately does anything stupid :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>The directories involved are:</p>
<ol>
<li>gcc/gcc/fortran/</li>
<li>gcc/gcc/testsuite/gfortran.dg/</li>
<li>gcc/gcc/testsuite/gfortran.fortran-torture/</li>
<li>gcc/libgfortran/</li>
</ol>

<h2>Binaries</h2>
<p>The GNU project is about providing source code for its programs.
Sometimes, however, it is easier to install a binary directly.
A number of people regularly build binaries for different platforms.
Links to these can be found in <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran#download">the wiki</a>.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The manuals for release and current development versions of GNU
Fortran 95 can be downloaded from <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran#download">the GCC documentation
page</a>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Here is a short <a href="usage.html">explanation</a> on how to invoke and
use the compiler once you have built it (or downloaded the binary).</p>

<h2>Suggested reading</h2>
<p>We provide links to some <a href="../readings.html#fortran">information</a>
relevant to Fortran programmers.</p>
