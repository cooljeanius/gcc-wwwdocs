<title>GNU Fortran -- Free number crunching FORALL!</title>

<body>

<h1>Welcome to the home of GNU Fortran</h1>

<p><strong>This web page is sadly out-of-date and difficult to maintain
due to several factors.  The rather small number of GNU Fortran
developers have a large list of bugs to squash or features to
implement, and the time spent maintaining this web page is better
spent elsewhere.  For up-to-date information, you may find the 
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran">gfortran wiki</a> 
a more useful site.  The gfortran wiki can be changed by anyone
who wishes to contribute.  Neither copyright paperwork
nor a patch review process is required.</strong></p>

<p>The GNU Fortran project, or gfortran, is developing a Fortran
compiler front end, as well as runtime libraries, for 
GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection. GNU Fortran development is a part of
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a>, aiming to bring free
number crunching to all GNU system variants.
The GNU Fortran development effort uses an open development environment in
order to attract a larger team of developers and to ensure that gfortran can
work on multiple architectures and diverse environments.</p>

<p>In particular, the project wishes to reach the users of the
Fortran 95 language, be it in the scientific community, in education
or in a commercial environment.</p>

<p>You can reach us at the
<a href="mailto:fortran@gcc.gnu.org">fortran@gcc.gnu.org</a>
mailing list; for details please refer to our
<a href="../lists.html">mailing lists page</a>.</p>

<h2>Project goal</h2>
<p>We strive to provide a high quality release, which we want to work
well on a variety of native targets.  Although we
believe we cannot make the best Fortran 95 compiler for any given target,
we want GNU Fortran to be adequate.</p>

<p>The focus is on conformance to the Fortran 95 standard and on good
performance of the executables produced by the compiler.  Secondary goals
include reasonable compile speed, a small memory foot print, the ability
to build a cross-compiler, and Fortran 2003 features.</p>

<h3>Extensions in GNU Fortran</h3>
<p>The primary goal of the GNU Fortran Project is the construction of a
Fortran 95 compiler that complies with the ISO Fortran 95 Programming
Language standard [ISO/IEC 1539-1:1997(E)].
The <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran">gfortran wiki</a> and
the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/">Bugzilla</a> contain of
features yet to be implemented for conformance.</p>

<h2>Status of compiler and run time library</h2>
<p>We regularly update the
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran#news">status of the
front end development and of the run time library development</a>.
For a TODO list, check <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/">Bugzilla</a>
and the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran">gfortran wiki</a>.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>We encourage everyone to <a href="../contribute.html">contribute changes</a>
and help test GNU Fortran.  GNU Fortran is developed on the mainline of GCC
and is part of the compiler collection since release 4.0.0 release of the
compiler collection.
We provide read access to our development sources for everybody with
<a href="../cvs.html">anonymous CVS</a>. If you do not have CVS access (for
instance because you are behind a firewall prohibiting the CVS protocol),
you might want to download <a href="../snapshots.html">snapshots</a>.</p>
<p>Contributions will be reviewed by the following people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul Brook</li>
<li>Steven Bosscher</li>
<li>Toon Moene</li>
<li>Tobias Schlueter</li>
<li>Bud Davis</li>
<li>Janne Blomqvist</li>
<li>Steve Kargl</li>
<li>Thomas Koenig</li>
<li>Paul Thomas</li>
<li>Francois-Xavier Coudert</li>
</ul>
<p>under the rules specified below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul Brook and Steven Bosscher can unilaterally commit patches they
deem reasonable, as they have set up the gfortran tree in GCC.</li>
<li>All <a href="../contribute.html">normal requirements</a> for patch
submission (assignment of copyright to the FSF, testing, changelog entries,
etc) still apply, and reviewers should ensure that these have been met
before approving changes.</li>
<li>Approval should be necessary for patches which don't fall under the
obvious rule, so with this list put in place everybody (except maintainers)
should <strong>still</strong> seek approval for his/her patches.</li>
<li>Patches should only be reviewed by people who know the affected parts
of the compiler.  I.e. the reviewer has to be sure he/she knows stuff well
enough to make a good judgement.</li>
<li>Large/complicated patches should still go by one of our maintainers.</li>
<li>We are all reasonable people, and nobody is working under employer
pressure or needs an ego-boost badly, so in general we assume that noone
deliberately does anything stupid :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>The directories involved are:</p>
<ol>
<li>gcc/gcc/fortran/</li>
<li>gcc/gcc/testsuite/gfortran.dg/</li>
<li>gcc/gcc/testsuite/gfortran.fortran-torture/</li>

</ol>

<h2>Binaries</h2>
<p>The GNU project is about providing source code for its programs.
Sometimes, however, it is easier to install a binary directly.
A number of people regularly build binaries for different platforms.
Links to these can be found in <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran#download">the wiki</a>.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The manuals for release and current development versions of GNU
Fortran can be downloaded from <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran#download">the GCC documentation
page</a>.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Here is a short <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranUsage">
explanation</a> on how to invoke and use the compiler once you have built
it (or downloaded the binary).</p>

<h2>Suggested reading</h2>
<p>We provide links to some <a href="../readings.html#fortran">
information</a> relevant to Fortran programmers; the
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran#manuals">gfortran wiki</a>
contains further links.</p>
