<h2 id="ov">Overview</h2>
<p>
G95 is not complete, but it should already be usable for some user
code. The implementations of <code>COMMON</code> and
<code>EQUIVALENCE</code> are fairly new and thus not well tested, so
give them a try.  For details on the status of the runtime library,
click <a href="librarystatus.html">here</a>. G95 is regularly compiled
on i386 GNU/Linux, PowerPC GNU/Linux, Cygwin and FreeBSD/i386, and can
thus be built out of the box most of the time there.
We're interested in your experiences on other platforms.
</p>

<p>
A precise listing of things that still need to be done can be found on
the <a href="todo.html">Open Projects</a> page.
</p>

<h2 id="fe">Frontend</h2>
<p>These are the parts of G95 which parse a source file, verify that it's
valid Fortran 95, perform compile time replacement of constants
(<code>PARAMETER</code> variables) and read and generate module files. This is
almost complete. Every non-Fortran 95 source should be rejected, every
Fortran 95 source should pass. If you find a source file where this is
not true, please tell us. You can use the <code>-fsyntax-only</code>
switch to make g95 quit after running the frontend, effectively reducing it
to a syntax checker.</p>

<p>Open projects include support for legacy
constructs, including the language features deleted from Fortran 95.</p>

<h2 id="me_intf">Middleend Interface</h2>
<p>These are the parts of G95 that take the parse tree generated by the
frontend and translate it to the GENERIC form required by the GCC
backend. Work is ongoing in these parts of G95, but a large part of this
work as already been completed.</p>

Current issues being worked on include:
<ul>
<li>Handling of <code>CHARACTER</code> variables in
<code>COMMON</code> blocks</li>
<li>Nested calls to functions returning arrays, e.g. <code>TRANSPOSE(TRANSPOSE(A(:,:))</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="be">Middleend and Backend</h2>
G95 uses the middleend and backend of GCC, more specifically, it is built on
the <a href="../projects/tree-ssa">Tree-SSA</a> branch
of GCC which is meant to become part of GCC 3.5. We hope to be able to
include at least a beta version of G95 into GCC by this time.

<h2 id="rb">Reporting Bugs</h2>
If you think you found a bug, please report it to the G95 development
list at <code><a
href="mailto:fortran@gcc.gnu.org">fortran@gcc.gnu.org</a></code>.
Please include the information necessary to reproduce the bug,
especially a minimal Fortran source that triggers the bug, information
on your computer architecture and the version of G95 you're using
(e.g. one of the binaries distributed by us, the date of the CVS
sources you used to compile G95 yourself etc.). If you're not sure if the
bug you found is an issue with the frontend or the backend, please try
using the <code>-fsyntax-only</code> command line switch.
