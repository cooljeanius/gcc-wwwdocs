<h2 id="ov">Overview</h2>
<p>
G95 is not complete, but it should already be usable for some user
code. The implementations of <code>COMMON</code> and
<code>EQUIVALENCE</code> are fairly new and thus not well tested, so
give them a try.  We provide <a href="librarystatus.html">details
on the status of the run time library</a>. G95 is regularly compiled
on i386 GNU/Linux, PowerPC GNU/Linux, Cygwin and FreeBSD/i386, and can
thus be built out of the box most of the time there.
We're interested in your experiences on other platforms.
</p>

<p>
A precise listing of things that still need to be done can be found on
the <a href="todo.html">Open Projects</a> page.
</p>

<h2 id="fe">Front end</h2>
<p>This is the part of G95 which parses a source file, verifies that it's
valid Fortran 95, performs compile time replacement of constants
(<code>PARAMETER</code> variables) and reads and generate module files. This is
almost complete. Every non-Fortran 95 source should be rejected, every
Fortran 95 source should pass. If you find a source file where this is
not true, please tell us. You can use the <code>-fsyntax-only</code>
switch to make g95 quit after running the front end, effectively reducing it
to a syntax checker.</p>

<p>Open projects include support for legacy
constructs, like the language features deleted from Fortran 95.</p>

<h2 id="me_intf">Middle end Interface</h2>
<p>These are the parts of G95 that take the parse tree generated by the
front end and translate it to the GENERIC form required by the GCC
back end. Work is ongoing in these parts of G95, but a large part
has already been completed.</p>

Current issues being worked on include:
<ul>
<li>Handling of <code>CHARACTER</code> variables in
<code>COMMON</code> blocks</li>
<li>Nested calls to functions returning arrays,
e.g. <code>TRANSPOSE(TRANSPOSE(A(:,:))</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="be">Middle end and Back end</h2>
G95 uses the middle end and back end of GCC, more specifically, it is built on
the <a href="../projects/tree-ssa">Tree-SSA</a> branch
of GCC which is meant to become part of GCC 3.5. We hope to be able to
include at least a beta version of G95 into GCC by this time.

<h2 id="rb">Reporting Bugs</h2>
If you think you found a bug, please report it to our
<code><a href="../bugs.html">bug database</a></code>.
Please include the information necessary to reproduce the bug,
especially a minimal Fortran source that triggers the bug, information
on your computer architecture and the version of G95 you're using
(e.g. one of the binaries distributed by us, the date of the CVS
sources you used to compile G95 yourself etc.). If you're not sure if the
bug you found is an issue with the front end or the back end, please try
using the <code>-fsyntax-only</code> command line switch.
