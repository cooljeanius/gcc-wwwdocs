<h1>GCC 4.1 Release Criteria</h1>

<p>This page provides the release criteria for GCC 4.1.</p>  

<p>The GCC team (and, in particular, the Release Manager) will attempt
to meet these criteria before the release of GCC 4.1.</p>

<p>In all cases, these criteria represent the minimum functionality
required in order to make the release.  If this level of minimum
functionality is not provided by a release candidate, then that
candidate will probably not become the eventual release.  However, a
release candidate that does meet these criteria may not necessarily
become the official release; there may be other unforseen issues that
prevent release.  For example, if support for the Intel Pentium II is
required by the release criteria, it is nevertheless unlikely that GCC
would be released even though it did not support the Intel Pentium.</p>

<p>Because the development of GCC is largely dependent on volunteers,
the Release Manager and/or Steering Committee may eventually have to
decide whether to make a release, even if the criteria here are not
met.  For example, if no volunteer can be found to verify correct
operation of a particular application program on a particular system,
then that criterion may be abandoned.</p>

<h1>Languages</h1>

<p>GCC supports several programming languages, including Ada, C, C++,
Objective-C, Fortran, and Java.  For the purposes of making releases,
however, we will consider primarily C and C++, as those are the
languages used by the vast majority of users.  Therefore, if, below,
the criteria indicate, for example, that there should be no DejaGNU
regressions on a particular platform, that criteria should be read as
applying only to DejaGNU regressions within the C, C++, and C++
runtime library testsuites.</p>

<h1>Primary and Secondary Platforms</h1>

<p>GCC targets a vast number of platforms.  We have classified these
platforms into three categories: primary, secondary, and tertiary.
Primary platforms are popular systems, both in the sense that there
are many such systems in existence and in the sense that GCC is used
frequently on those systems.  Secondary platforms are also popular
systems, but are either somewhat less popular than the primary
systems, or are considered duplicative from a testing perspective.
All platforms that are neither primary nor secondary are tertiary
platforms.</p>

<p>Our release criteria for primary platforms is:</p>
<ul>

<li>
<p>All regressions open in Bugzilla have been analyzed, and all are
deemed as either unlikely to affect most users, or are determined to
have a minimal impact on affected users.  For example, a
typographical error in a diagnostic might be relatively common, but
also has minimal impact on users.</p>

<p>In general, regressions where the compiler generates incorrect
code, or refuses to compile a valid program, will be considered to
be sufficiently severe to block the release, unless there are
substantial mitigating factors.</p>
</li>  

<li>The DejaGNU testsuite has been run, and compared with a run of
the testsuite on the previous release of GCC, and no regressions are
observed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our release criteria for the secondary platforms is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The compiler bootstraps successfully, and the C++ runtime library
builds.</li>

<li>The DejaGNU testsuite has been run, and a substantial majority of
the tests pass.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no release criteria for tertiary platforms.</p>

<p>In contrast to previous releases, we have removed all mention of
explicit application testing.  It is our experience that, with the
resources available, it is very difficult to methodically carry out
such testing. However, we expect that interested users will submit
bug reports for problems encountered building and using popular
packages.  Therefore, we do not intend the elimination of application
testing from our criteria to imply that we will not pay attention to
application testing.</p>

<h2>Primary Platform List</h2>

<p>The primary platforms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>arm-none-elf</li>
<li>hppa2.0w-hp-hpux11.11</li>
<li>i686-pc-linux-gnu</li>
<li>i386-unknown-freebsd</li>
<li>mips-none-elf</li>
<li>powerpc-ibm-aix5.2.0.0</li>
<li>sparc-sun-solaris2.9</li>
<li>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</li>
</ul>

<h2>Secondary Platform List</h2>

<p>The secondary platforms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>powerpc-apple-darwin</li>
<li>powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu</li>
<li>i686-pc-cygwin</li>
<li>ia64-unknown-linux-gnu</li>
</ul>

<h1>Code Quality and Compilation Time</h1>

<p>In addition to correctness issues (e.g., generating incorrect code,
or issuing an invalid diagnostic, or refusing to compile valid code),
we will also consider code quality (i.e., the speed with which the
generated code executes) and compilation time (i.e., the speed with
which the compiler executes).</p>

<p>It is difficult, if not impossible, to set out specific criteria
for determining what level of regression is acceptable for these issues.
In contrast to most correctness issues, where nothing short of correct
is acceptable, it is reasonable to trade off behavior for code quality
and compilation time.  For example, it may be acceptable, when
compiling with optimization, if the compiler is slower, but generates
superior code.  It may also be acceptable for the compiler to generate
inferior code on some test cases if it generates substantially
superior code on other test cases.  Therefore, the Release Manager, or
parties to whom he or she delegates responsibility, will make
determinations on a case-by-case basis as to whether or not a code
quality or compilation time regression is sufficiently severe as to
merit blocking the release.</p>
