<h1>How to Minimize Test Cases for Bugs</h1>

<p>In order for a GCC developer to fix a bug, the bug must be
reproducible by means of a self-contained test case. Our
<a href="../bugs.html">bug reporting instructions</a>
ask that a bug report include the preprocessed version of the file that
triggers the bug.  Often this file is very large; there are several
reasons for making it as small as possible:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Removal proprietary source may be
  required to allow publication.</li>

  <li>Test cases are more easily reproducible if there are fewer dependencies
  on target system features, such as system headers.</li>

  <li>Smaller test cases make debugging easier.</li>

  <li>GCC developers prefer bug reports with small, portable test cases.</li>

  <li>Minimized test cases can be added to the GCC test suites.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most test cases can be reduced to fewer than 30 lines.</p>

<h2>Direct approach</h2>

<p>Always try a direct approach before resorting to the brute-force
method of minimizing a large test case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Write a small test case based on the code at the location
  reported in an error message.  If the test needs to call a library
  function (e.g., <code>printf</code>), specify the function's
  declaration directly rather than including a header file.</li>

  <li>For suspected bugs in a GCC runtime library, write a small test case that
  calls that function, either directly or indirectly, with the arguments
  that cause it to fail.  It's OK to include header files that are part
  of the GCC release.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Brute force approach</h2>

<p>The brute force approach gets easier with experience.  The first
time it can take an hour or two, but some people report getting it
down to 20 minutes or so per test case. It is basically an iterative
method to cut down on the size of the test case by deleting chunks of 
code.</p>

<p>After each attempt to shorten the test case, check whether the bug
still is evident.  If not, back out to the previous version that
demonstrated the bug, and try something else. For this, either use the undo
function of your editor, or use frequent backup files; alternatively, you
can use <code>#if 0</code> and <code>#endif</code>.</p> 

<p>If you have access to the original sources, you've got the choice of starting
either with these or with a preprocessed file. Both methods are described
below.</p> 

<h3>Stripping the original code</h3>

<p>Copy the original source file, plus header files that you might need
to modify, to a separate location where you can duplicate the failure.
Try the following, backing up from the unsuccessful attempts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Delete all functions that follow the one that triggers the failure.

  <ul>
    <li>If it's in an inline function, remove the <code>inline</code>
    directive or write a dummy function to call it.</li>

    <li>If it's a template function, provide an explicit
    instantiation.</li>
  </ul></li>

  <li>Strip as much code as possible from the function that triggers
  the failure; the remaining code doesn't need to make sense.

  <ul>
    <li>Remove function calls.</li>
    <li>Remove C++ I/O.  If you need output to demonstrate
    the bug, use <code>printf</code> and declare it directly:
    <code>extern "C" int printf(const char *, ...);</code>.</li>
    <li>Remove unused variables.</li>
    <li>Replace user-defined types (structs, classes) with built-in types
    (<code>int</code>, <code>double</code>).</li>
    <li>Replace typedefs with primitive types.</li>
  </ul></li>

  <li>Delete functions that come before the function that triggers the
  failure, or replace their definitions with declarations.</li>

  <li>Move includes of system headers before other headers.</li>

  <li>Remove <code>#include</code> directives, or replace them with
  only the code the included file to compile the main file.</li>

  <li>Replace C++ templates with regular functions and classes, or
  get rid of as many template arguments as possible.</li>

  <li>Iterate through the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Remove unused class and struct members.</li>

      <li>Remove definitions of unused data types.</li>

      <li>Remove includes of unneeded header files.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</ul>

<p>Usually, the file will now be down to fewer than 30 lines, plus
includes.  Repeat the same steps with remaining included header files.
To reduce the number of files you are working on, you can directly
include the content of the header file into the source file you are
working on.</p>

<p>In the next step, run the compiler with <code>-save-temps</code> to get the
preprocessed source file.</p>

<h2>Stripping preprocessed sources</h2>

<p>The preprocessed file contains lines starting with <code>#</code>
that tell the compiler the original file and line number of each line
of code. Remove these file and line directives from the preprocessed file so
that the compiler will report locations in the preprocessed file, using one
of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>perl -pi -e 's/^#.*\n//g;' bug.ii</code></li>
  <li><code>sed '/^#/d' bug.ii &gt; bug2.ii</code></li>
  <li>within <code>vi</code>: <code>:g/^#/d</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The preprocessed sources will now consist largely of header files.
Follow the same steps as for stripping the original code, with these
additional techniques.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There will be large stretches of typedefs from system headers
  and, for C++, things enclosed in namespaces.  Delete
  large chunks working from the bottom up, e.g. whole <code>extern "C"</code>
  blocks, or blocks enclosed in <code>namespace XXX {...}</code>.</li>

  <li>If you get a new compiler error due to a missing definition for
  a function or type that you deleted, replace the whole deleted chunk
  with only the missing declaration, or modify the code to no longer
  use it.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this stage, you will be able to delete chunks of hundreds or even
thousands of lines at a time and can quickly reduce the preprocessed
sources to something small.</p>
