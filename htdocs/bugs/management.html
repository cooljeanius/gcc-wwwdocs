<h1>Managing Bugs (Bugzilla and the test-suite)</h1>

<p>This section contains information mostly intended for GCC
contributors.</p>

<p>If you find a bug, but you are not fixing it (yet):</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a (minimal) test-case.</li>
<li>Add the test-case to our test-suite, marking it as XFAIL unless
the bug is a regression.</li>
<li>Add a bug report referencing the test-case to Bugzilla.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to provide additional information in the bug tracking
system about a reported bug:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the bug is a segmentation fault in the compiler,
<a href="segfault.html">provide information about its location</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="minimize.html">Minimize the test case</a>.</li>
<li>Try the test case with earlier and later versions of GCC to
determine which versions it affects and whether it is a regression.
If it is a regression, <a href="reghunt.html">identify the
patch</a> that introduced it.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you fix a bug for which there is already a Bugzilla entry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the XFAIL on the test-case.</li>
<li>Close the bug report in Bugzilla.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you find a bug, and you are fixing it right then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a (minimal) test-case.</li>
<li>Add the test-case to our test-suite, marking it as PASS.</li>
<li>Check in your fixes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Maintainer's View of Fields</h2>

<p>Bugzilla offers a number of different fields.  From a maintainer's
perspective, these are the relevant ones and what their values mean:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4" summary="States">

<tr align="center">
<th><h3 id="status">Status</h3></th>
<th><h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3></th>
</tr>

<tr valign="top">
<td>The <em>status</em> field indicates the general health of a bug. Only
certain status transitions are allowed.</td>
<td>The <em>resolution</em> field indicates what happened to this bug.</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top"><td>

<dl>
<dt><b>UNCONFIRMED</b></dt>
<dd>The PR has been filed and the responsible person(s) notified.</dd>

<dt><b>NEW</b></dt>
<dd>A maintainer has verified that this is indeed a bug in GCC. Every
once in a while, old reports will need to be rechecked, to find out
whether the bug still exists.</dd>

<dt><b>WAITING</b></dt>
<dd>The submitter was asked for further information, or asked to try
out a patch. The PR remains in that state until the submitter
responds.</dd>

<dt><b>SUSPENDED</b></dt>
<dd>Work on the problem has been postponed.  This happens if a timely
solution is not possible or is not cost-effective at the present time.
The PR continues to exist, though a solution is not being actively
sought. If the problem cannot be solved at all, it should be closed
rather than suspended.</dd>

<dt><b>ASSIGNED</b></dt>
<dd> This bug is not yet resolved, but is assigned to the proper
person. From here bugs can be given to another person and become
<b>NEW</b>, or resolved and become <b>RESOLVED</b>.</dd>
     
<dt><b>REOPENED</b></dt>
<dd>This bug was once resolved, but the resolution was deemed
incorrect.  For example, a <b>WORKSFORME</b> bug is
<b>REOPENED</b> when more information shows up and the bug is now
reproducible.  From here bugs are either marked <b>ASSIGNED</b>
or <b>RESOLVED</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</td>

<td>
No resolution yet. All bugs which are in one of these "open" states
have the resolution set to blank. All other bugs
will be marked with one of the following resolutions.
</td>
</tr>

<tr valign="top"><td>
<dl>
<dt><b>RESOLVED</b></dt>
<dd> A resolution has been found for this bug. The bug is either closed
for good, or can be re-opened and change to <b>REOPENED</b>.</dd>

</dl>
</td>
<td>
<dl>
<dt><b>FIXED</b></dt>
<dd> A fix for this bug is checked into the tree and tested.</dd>

<dt><b>INVALID</b></dt>
<dd> The problem described is not a bug</dd> 

<dt><b>WONTFIX</b></dt>
<dd> The problem described is a bug which will never be fixed.</dd>

<dt><b>DUPLICATE</b></dt>
<dd> The problem is a duplicate of an existing bug. Marking a bug
duplicate requires the bug# of the duplicating bug and will at
least put that bug number in the description field.</dd>
     
<dt><b>WORKSFORME</b></dt>
<dd> All attempts at reproducing this bug were futile, reading the
code produces no clues as to why this behavior would occur. If
more information appears later, please re-assign the bug, for
now, file it.</dd>
</dl>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4"><tr>
<td valign="top">

<h3 align="center" id="severity">Severity</h3>
This field describes the impact of a bug.
<table>
<tr><th>Blocker</th><td>Blocks development and/or testing work; note that this
is reserved to maintainers, indicating that a certain problem must be solved
before the next version of GCC is released </td></tr>
<tr><th>Critical</th><td>crashes, loss of data, severe memory leak </td></tr>
<tr><th>Major</th><td>major loss of function </td></tr>
<tr><th>Minor</th><td>minor loss of function, or other problem where 
easy workaround is present </td></tr>
<tr><th>Trivial</th><td>cosmetic problem like misspelled words or 
misaligned text</td></tr> 
<tr><th>Enhancement</th><td>Request for enhancement</td></tr>
</table> 

</td><td valign="top">

<h3 align="center" id="priority">Priority</h3>
This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be
fixed.  It is utilized by the programmers/engineers to
prioritize their work to be done.  The available priorities are:

<table cellspacing="3">
<tr><th>P1</th><td>Most important</td></tr>
<tr><th>P2</th><td>More important</td></tr>
<tr><th>P3</th><td></td></tr>
<tr><th>P4</th><td>Less important</td></tr>
<tr><th>P5</th><td>Least important</td></tr>

</td></tr>

<h2>Procedures and Policies</h2>

<p><strong>Bugs that are in state "WAITING"</strong> because they lack
information that is necessary for reproducing the problem can be closed
if no response was received for three months.</p>

<p><strong>Regressions</strong> should be explicitly marked as such.
The synopsis line should read</p>

<blockquote>
[&lt;branches-to-fix&gt; regression] &lt;rest-of-synopsis&gt;
</blockquote>

<p>where &lt;branches-to-fix&gt; is the list of <em>maintained</em>
branches (separated by slashes) that need fixing. A regression should
start with severity "<strong>blocker</strong>" to bring it to attention.
It may be downgraded later if a defect is not important enough to justify
"blocker" severity.</p>

<p><strong>Bugs in component "bootstrap"</strong> that refer to older
releases or snapshots/CVS versions should be put into state "WAITING",
asking the reporter whether she can still reproduce the problem and to
report her findings in any case (whether positive or negative).</p>

<ul>
<li>If the response is "works now", close the report,</li>
<li>if the reponse is "still broken", change the state to "NEW", and</li>
<li>if no response arrives, close the PR after three months.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bugs with keyword "ice-on-invalid-code"</strong>, where gcc
emits a sensible error message before issuing an ICE (the ICE will be
replaced by the message "confused by earlier errors, bailing out" in
release versions) should get "minor" severity.
It should be noted in the comments that the error recovery fails.</p>
