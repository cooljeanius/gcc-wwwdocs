<h1>Managing Bugs (GNATS and the test-suite)</h1>

<p>This section contains information mostly intended for GCC
contributors.</p>

<p>If you find a bug, but you are not fixing it (yet):</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a (minimal) test-case.</li>
<li>Add the test-case to our test-suite, marking it as XFAIL unless
the bug is a regression.</li>
<li>Add a bug report referencing the test-case to GNATS.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to provide additional information in the bug tracking
system about a reported bug:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the bug is a segmentation fault in the compiler,
<a href="segfault.html">provide information about its location</a>.
</li>
<li><a href="minimize.html">Minimize the test case</a>.</li>
<li>Try the test case with earlier and later versions of GCC to
determine which versions it affects and whether it is a regression.
If it is a regression, <a href="reghunt.html">identify the
patch</a> that introduced it.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you fix a bug for which there is already a GNATS entry:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the XFAIL on the test-case.</li>
<li>Close the bug report in GNATS.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you find a bug, and you are fixing it right then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a (minimal) test-case.</li>
<li>Add the test-case to our test-suite, marking it as PASS.</li>
<li>Check in your fixes.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Maintainer's View of Fields</h2>

<p>As a GCC-specific convention, we will attach a special meaning to
some fields. The State field should be used in the following way:</p>

<dl>

<dt>open</dt>
<dd>The PR has been filed and the responsible person(s) notified.</dd>

<dt>analyzed</dt>

<dd>A maintainer has verified that this is indeed a bug in GCC. Every
once in a while, old reports will need to be rechecked, to find out
whether the bug still exists. At that time, an indication should be
left in the report who tested the bug and when.</dd>

<dt>feedback</dt>
<dd>The submitter was asked for further information, or asked to try
out a patch. The PR remains in that state until the submitter
responds.</dd>

<dt>suspended</dt>
<dd>Work on the problem has been postponed.  This happens if a timely
solution is not possible or is not cost-effective at the present time.
The PR continues to exist, though a solution is not being actively
sought. If the problem cannot be solved at all, it should be closed
rather than suspended.</dd>

</dl>

<p>In addition, the <b>high</b> priority is reserved to maintainers in
GCC, indicating that a certain problem must be solved before the next
version of GCC is released.</p>

<h2>Procedures and Policies</h2>

<p><strong>Bugs that are in state "feedback"</strong> because they lack
information that is necessary for reproducing the problem can be closed
if no response was received for three months.</p>

<p><strong>Regressions</strong> should be explicitly marked as such.
The synopsis line should read</p>

<blockquote>
[&lt;branches-to-fix&gt; regression] &lt;rest-of-synopsis&gt;
</blockquote>

<p>where &lt;branches-to-fix&gt; is the list of <em>maintained</em>
branches (separated by slashes) that need fixing. A regression should
start with priority "<strong>high</strong>" to bring it to attention.
It may be downgraded later if a defect is not important enough to justify
"high priority".</p>

<p><strong>Bugs in category "bootstrap"</strong> that refer to older
releases or snapshots/CVS versions should be put into state "feedback",
asking the reporter whether she can still reproduce the problem and to
report her findings in any case (whether positive or negative).</p>

<ul>
<li>If the response is "works now", close the report,</li>
<li>if the reponse is "still broken", change the state to "open", and</li>
<li>if no response arrives, close the PR after three months.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bugs in category "ice-on-illegal-code"</strong>, where gcc
emits a sensible error message before issuing an ICE (the ICE will be
replaced by the message "confused by earlier errors, bailing out" in
release versions) should get "low" priority.
It should be noted in the audit trail, that the error recovery fails.</p>
