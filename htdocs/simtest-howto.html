    <h1>How to test GCC on a simulator</h1>

    <p>Several GCC targets can be tested using simulators.  These allow
    you to test GCC for a specific processor for which you don't have
    access to hardware, or for targets that have general characteristics
    you'd like to test, like endianness or word size.</p>

    <p>All of the instructions here start out from a directory we'll
    call <code>${TOP}</code>, which is initially empty.</p>

    <h2>Set up sources</h2>

    <p>Testing with a simulator makes use of a combined tree here;
    you can't easily build newlib, required for simulator testing,
    outside of a combined tree, and the build of the other components
    is easiest in a combined tree.  A combined tree is not a
    <em>requirement</em> for testing with a simulator; other alternatives
    exist.  For example, binutils and simulators can be built for the
    target, and installed beforehand.  However, we use a combined tree
    here as it's a convenient example and does not require separate
    installation steps or parameters.</p>

    <p>The combined tree contains GCC sources plus <code>binutils</code> and
    <code>newlib</code> for the generated code and <code>sim</code> for the
    simulators. If you already build with a combined tree you can use
    your current setup; if not, these instructions will get you the
    sources you need.</p>

    <h3>Check out initial trees</h3>

    <p>We check out each component from each separate project's
    repository, but it's possible to use
    release or snapshot tarballs, with an increased risk of version
    lag causing configuration framework mismatches in the combined
    tree.  If you don't yet have either tree you'll need to do some
    initial check-outs.</p>

    <p>Check out mainline GCC:</p>

<pre>
cd ${TOP}
svn checkout svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk gcc
# This makes sure that file timestamps are in order initially.
cd ${TOP}/gcc
contrib/gcc_update --touch
</pre>

    <p>Check out the <code>newlib</code> (src) tree:</p>

<pre>
cd ${TOP}
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sourceware.org:/cvs/src login
# You will be prompted for a password; reply with "anoncvs".
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sourceware.org:/cvs/src co newlib
</pre>

    <p>Check out the <code>sim</code> and <code>binutils</code> tree:</p>

<pre>
cd ${TOP}
git clone git://sourceware.org/git/binutils-gdb.git sim+binutils
</pre>

    <h3>Update trees</h3>

    <p>You can update existing CVS, git and subversion trees rather than
    starting from scratch each time.  Update the GCC tree using the
    <code>gcc_update</code> script, which touches generated files and
    handles directory changes in the tree.  Be sure to do this from
    the directory in which you did the original check-out, NOT in the
    combined tree:</p>

<pre>
cd ${TOP}/gcc
contrib/gcc_update
</pre>

    <p>Update the newlib <code>src</code> tree with the same sequence of
    commands that you used to <em>check out</em> that tree initially
    (edits in the <code>src</code> tree will be preserved).
    Make sure you do <em>not</em> do this from within the combined tree.
    For the binutils+sim tree a normal <code>git pull</code> command will do.
    Remove the combined tree and re-create it.  (Beware, edits in the
    combined tree will be lost.)</p>

    <h3>Create a combined tree</h3>

    <p>Create a tree that consists of all of the files from the GCC and
    binutils/sim/newlib source trees (including several simulators in
    the <code>sim</code> directory), with the GCC files overriding the
    binutils/sim/newlib files when there's a conflict, and binutils and
    with sim overriding newlib files.  It's done this way because the GCC
    files are the master copy, while binutils and gdb move faster than
    newlib. To save on disk
    space, these commands actually make a tree of hard links rather
    than duplicating all the files:</p>

<pre>
cd ${TOP}
rm -rf combined
mkdir combined
cd src &amp;&amp; find . -print | cpio -pdlm ../combined &amp;&amp; cd ..
cd sim+binutils &amp;&amp; find . -print | cpio -pdlmu ../combined &amp;&amp; cd ..
cd gcc &amp;&amp; find . -print | cpio -pdlmu ../combined &amp;&amp; cd ..
</pre>

    <h2>Build it</h2>

    <p>Make sure the
    <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html">building
    prerequisites</a> for GCC are met, for example a host GCC no earlier
    than 3.4 or later, with C++ support enabled.</p>

    <p>The target name suitable for the simulator is usually `*-elf' for a
    target `*'.  There are some exceptions, for instance on powerpc
    it's powerpc-eabi or powerpc-eabisim, and for arm, the arm-elf support
    is obsoleted.  Here we build <code>arm-eabi</code>, but we avoid gdb
    and build only for the C and C++ languages, because some of the targets
    mentioned below will otherwise fail building.</p>

<pre>
cd ${TOP}
mkdir build install
cd build
../combined/configure \
    --target=arm-eabi --disable-gdb --enable-languages=c,c++ --prefix=${TOP}/install
make
</pre>

    <h2>Test it</h2>

    <p>The only trick here is that you want DejaGNU to use the simulator
    rather than trying to run the output on the build system.  For
    example:</p>

<pre>
cd ${TOP}/build
make check-gcc check-target-libstdc++-v3 RUNTESTFLAGS=--target_board=arm-sim
</pre>
or just
<pre>
cd ${TOP}/build
make check RUNTESTFLAGS=--target_board=arm-sim
</pre>
to exercise the just-built gcc on every test-suite in the tree.

    <p>The only reliable way (apart from guessing that it's probably
    `*-sim') to find out the name of the target board is to look in the
    DejaGNU sources, in <code>/usr/share/dejagnu/baseboards</code>, for
    something that looks right.  Or you can use this table of combinations
    that at one time compiled, usable as test-targets with the
    instructions above.</p>

    <p>You can compare your test results against the archived results
    linked below to detect major problems.  As always, if you're testing
    a patch you should compare your results with and without the patch.</p>

    <p>The target characteristic can help you determine which targets to
    use to broaden the scope of your testing.  A cc0 target uses a
    single condition code register, cc0, which is set as a side effect
    of most instructions.  The compiler cannot insert other instructions
    between the instruction that sets cc0 and the one that uses it.
    Because of this, a cc0 target causes
    significantly different code to be generated and can matter more
    than word size and endianness in terms of detecting new breakage.</p>
