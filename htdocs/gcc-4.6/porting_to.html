<h1>Porting to GCC 4.6</h1>

<p>
The GCC 4.6 release series differs from previous GCC releases in more
than the usual list of
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.6/changes.html">changes</a>. Some of
these are a result of bug fixing, and some old behaviors have been
intentionally changed in order to support new standards, or relaxed
in standards-conforming ways to facilitate compilation or runtime
performance.  Some of these changes are not visible to the naked eye
and will not cause problems when updating from older versions.
</p>

<p>
However, some of these changes are visible, and can cause grief to
users porting to GCC 4.6. This document is an effort to identify major
issues and provide clear solutions in a quick and easily searched
manner. Additions and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
</p>

<h2>C language issues</h2>

<h3>New warnings for unused variables and parameters</h3>

<p>
The behavior of <code>-Wall</code> has changed and now includes the
new warning flags <code>-Wunused-but-set-variable</code> and
(with <code>-Wall
-Wextra</code>) <code>-Wunused-but-set-parameter</code>. This may
result in new warnings in code that compiled cleanly with previous
versions of GCC.
</p>

<p>For example,</p>
<pre>
  void fn (void)
  {
    int foo;
    foo = bar ();  /* foo is never used.  */
  }
</pre>
<p>Gives the following diagnostic:</p>
<pre>
warning: variable "foo" set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
</pre>

<p>Although these warnings will not result in compilation failure,
often <code>-Wall</code> is used in conjunction with
<code>-Werror</code> and as a result, new warnings are turned into
new errors.</p>
 
<p>To fix, first see if the unused variable or parameter can be removed
without changing the result or logic of the surrounding code. If not,
annotate it with <code>__attribute__((__unused__))</code>.</p>
 
<p>As a workaround, remove <code>-Werror</code> until the new warnings
are fixed.  For conversion warnings add
<code>-Wno-unused-but-set-variable</code> or
<code>-Wno-unused-but-set-parameter</code>.</p>


<h2>C++ language issues</h2>

<h3>Header dependency changes</h3>

<p>
Many of the standard C++ library include files have been edited to no
longer include &lt;cstddef&gt; to get <code>namespace std</code>
-scoped versions of <code>size_t</code> and <code>ptrdiff_t</code>. 
</p>

<p>
As such, C++ programs that used the macros <code>NULL</code>
or <code>offsetof</code> without including &lt;cstddef&gt; will no
longer compile. The diagnostic produced is similar to:
</p>

<pre>
error: 'ptrdiff_t' does not name a type
</pre>

<pre>
error: 'size_t' has not been declared
</pre>

<pre>
error: 'NULL' was not declared in this scope
</pre>

<pre>
error: there are no arguments to 'offsetof' that depend on a template
parameter, so a declaration of 'offsetof' must be available
</pre>

<p>
Fixing this issue is easy: just include &lt;cstddef&gt;.
