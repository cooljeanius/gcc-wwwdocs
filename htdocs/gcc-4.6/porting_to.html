<h1>Porting to GCC 4.6</h1>

<p>
The GCC 4.6 release series differs from previous GCC releases in more
than the usual list of
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.6/changes.html">changes</a>. Some of
these are a result of bug fixing, and some old behaviors have been
intentionally changed in order to support new standards, or relaxed
instandards-conforming ways to facilitate compilation or runtime
performance.  Some of these changes are not visible to the naked eye
and will not cause problems when updating from older versions.
</p>

<p>
However, some of these changes are visible, and can cause grief to
users porting to GCC 4.6. This document is an effort to identify major
issues and provide clear solutions in a quick and easily searched
manner. Additions and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
</p>

<h2>C language issues</h2>

<h3>New warnings for unused variables and parameters</h3>

<p>
The behavior of <code>-Wall</code> has changed and now includes the
new warning flags <code>-Wunused-but-set-variable</code> and
(with <code>-Wall
-Wextra</code>) <code>-Wunused-but-set-parameter</code>. This may
result in new warnings in code that compiled cleanly with previous
versions of GCC.
</p>

<p>
For example,
<pre>
  void fn (void)
  {
    int foo;
    foo = bar ();  /* foo is never used.  */
  }
</pre>
Gives the following diagnostic:
<pre>
warning: variable "foo" set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
</pre>
</p>
low</code> flag
with <code>-Werror</code> and optimization flags above <code>-O2</code>
may result in compile errors when using glibc optimizations
for <code>strcmp</code>.
</p>

<p>
For example,
<pre>
#include <string.h>
void do_rm_rf (const char *p) { if (strcmp (p, "/") == 0) return; }
</pre>
Results in the following diagnostic:
<pre>
error: assuming signed overflow does not occur when changing X +- C1 cmp C2 to X cmp C1 +- C2 [-Werror=strict-overflow]
</pre>
</p>

<p>
To work around this, use <code>-D__NO_STRING_INLINES</code>.
</p>

<h2>C++ language issues</h2>

<h3>Header dependency changes</h3>

<p>
Many of the standard C++ library include files have been edited to no
longer include &lt;cstddef&gt; to get <code>namespace std</code>
-scoped versions of <code>size_t</code> and <code>ptrdiff_t</code>. 
</p>

<p>
As such, C++ programs that used the macros <code>NULL</code>
or <code>offsetof</code> without including &lt;cstddef&gt; will no
longer compile. The diagnostic produced is similar to:
</p>

<pre>
error: 'ptrdiff_t' does not name a type
</pre>

<pre>
error: 'size_t' has not been declared
</pre>

<pre>
error: 'NULL' was not declared in this scope
</pre>

<pre>
error: there are no arguments to 'offsetof' that depend on a template
parameter, so a declaration of 'offsetof' must be available
</pre>

<p>
Fixing this issue is easy: just include &lt;cstddef&gt;.
