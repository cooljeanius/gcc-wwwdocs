<title> Read-write CVS access</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>February 2, 1998

<p>It took longer than we would have liked, but we now have read/write
access available the CVS repository for all our significant developers.

<p>If you don't already have CVS, we recommend you pick up a recent copy from
cyclic software at <a href="http://www.cyclic.com/"> http://www.cyclic.com</a>.

<p>Authenticated access is provided via ssh, which you can retrieve from
<a href="http://www.cs.hut.fi/ssh/">http://www.cs.hut.fi</a>.  ssh should
build and install without any trouble and the default configuration files
should be suitable for access to the egcs CVS server.  Packaged versions
for Debian and RedHat GNU/Linux systems are available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.replay.com/pub/replay/pub/linux">
ftp://ftp.replay.com/pub/replay/pub/linux</a>.

<p>You will need to provide us with your public key.  You can generate one
via the "ssh-keygen" program.  This will store your public key in to the
file .ssh/identity.pub in your home directory.  We need the entire contents
of that file.  You should mail it directly to <a href="mailto:law@cygnus.com">
law@cygnus.com</a>.  Yes, we realize it's a public key, but there's no sense
 in cluttering up the developers list with keys.

<p>Once we have this information we will set up an account on egcs.cygnus.com
and send you mail notifying you that the account is ready.  At this point you
should be able to check out a tree with CVS and add yourself to the MAINTAINERS
file to test write access.


<h2>Setting up your local CVS tree</h2>

<p>Once you can login to the machine, it's trivial to start using ssh from
your remote machine.  Set CVS_RSH in your environment to "ssh".  Then issue
the command

<blockquote><code>
cvs -z 9 -d username@egcs.cygnus.com:/egcs/carton/cvsfiles co egcs
</code></blockquote>

where <code>username</code> is your user name at egcs.cygnus.com.
This will check out a new CVS tree that you should be able to work with
in the normal fashion, including committing changes.


<p>It is also possible to convert an existing CVS tree to use ssh by replacing
all the "Root" files in the local tree with the following contents:

<blockquote><code>
username@egcs.cygnus.com:/egcs/carton/cvsfiles
</code></blockquote>


<p>To avoid the nuisance of having to supply your passphrase for each
operation, you may want to use <code>ssh-agent</code>(1) followed by
<code>ssh-add</code>(1) and entering your passphrase once for all.
Either start your session as a child of <code>ssh-agent</code> or run
it as a demon and set the values of the environment variables
<code>SSH_AUTHENTICATION_SOCKET</code> and <code>SSH_AGENT_PID</code>
in each relevant process to what <code>ssh-agent</code> prints when it
starts.  To avoid messages about (lack of) X11 forwarding, put in your
<samp>~/.ssh/config</samp> and entry like:
<blockquote><code>
Host egcs.cygnus.com<br>
ForwardX11 no
</code></blockquote>

<p>Enjoy!

<p>Late breaking news: the web pages and CGI scripts are now also
editable remotely.  Check out wwwdocs instead of egcs (e.g. type
<blockquote><code>
cvs -z 9 -d egcs.cygnus.com:/egcs/carton/cvsfiles co wwwdocs
</code></blockquote>
on your workstation) and make whatever changes you deem necessary.
Web pages go under htdocs/, cgi scripts under cgi-bin/.  When you check
your changes back in they will automatically be checked out into the
web server's data area.
