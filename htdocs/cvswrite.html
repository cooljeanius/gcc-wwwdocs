<title>Read-write CVS access</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>We have read/write access to the CVS repository available for all our
significant developers.

<p>If you don't already have CVS, we recommend you pick up a recent copy from
cyclic software at <a href="http://www.cyclic.com/">http://www.cyclic.com</a>.

<p>Authenticated access is provided via ssh, which you can retrieve from
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/">ftp://ftp.cs.hut.fi/pub/ssh/</a>.
ssh should build and install without any trouble and the default
configuration files should be suitable for access to our CVS server.

<p>You will need to provide us with your public key.  You can generate one
via the "ssh-keygen" program.  This will store your public key in to the
file .ssh/identity.pub in your home directory.  We need the entire contents
of that file.  You should mail it directly to <a href="mailto:law@cygnus.com">
law@cygnus.com</a>.  Yes, we realize it's a public key, but there's no sense
 in cluttering up the developers list with keys.

<p>Once we have this information we will set up an account on
gcc.gnu.org and inform you by mail.  At this point you should be
able to check out a tree with CVS and add yourself to the MAINTAINERS
file to test write access.  See <a href="checkin.html">checkin.html</a>
for how to proceed with checking in your changes.


<h2>Setting up your local CVS tree</h2>

<p>Once you can login to the machine, it's trivial to start using ssh from
your remote machine.  Set CVS_RSH in your environment to "ssh".  Then issue
the command

<blockquote><code>
cvs -z 9 -d :ext:username@gcc.gnu.org:/cvs/gcc co egcs
</code></blockquote>

where <code>username</code> is your user name at gcc.gnu.org.
This will check out a new CVS tree that you should be able to work with
in the normal fashion, including committing changes.


<p>It is also possible to convert an existing CVS tree to use ssh by replacing
all the "Root" files in the local tree with the following contents:

<blockquote><code>
username@gcc.gnu.org:/cvs/gcc
</code></blockquote>


<p>To avoid the nuisance of having to supply your passphrase for each
operation, you may want to use <code>ssh-agent</code>(1) followed by
<code>ssh-add</code>(1) and entering your passphrase once for all.
Either start your session as a child of <code>ssh-agent</code> or run
it as a demon and set the values of the environment variables
<code>SSH_AUTHENTICATION_SOCKET</code> and <code>SSH_AGENT_PID</code>
in each relevant process to what <code>ssh-agent</code> prints when it
starts.  To avoid messages about (lack of) X11 forwarding, put in your
<samp>$HOME/.ssh/config</samp> and entry like:
<blockquote><code>
Host gcc.gnu.org<br>
ForwardX11 no
</code></blockquote>

<h2>Web pages</h2>

<p>Note that when you check in changes to our web pages, these will
automatically be checked out into the web server's data area.
