<p>The egcs project is approaching its third major release (egcs-1.2).

<!-- <p>This page is meant to provide information about the current schedule
for egcs-1.2, the <a href="egcs-1.2-test.html">testing/release criteria</a>
for egcs-1.2, <a href="features.html">new features</a> to be found in
egcs-1.2, etc. -->

<p>This page is meant to provide information about the current schedule
for egcs-1.2.

<p> At the current time we are trying to wrap up a number of major issues
before the release cycle gets into full swing.  Specifically:

<ul>
  <li> fast-fixincludes.  Enabled by default.  Still have issues to resolve.
  <ul>
    <li> Mising fixes.  We need to add known missing fixes, then verify
         that the new scheme is working 100% reliably on the major
	 hosts by comparing with the old fixincludes scheme.
    <li> Missing dependencies in the generated Makefile
    <li> Windows issues
    <li> Move fixinc.* selection logic from  mkfixinc.sh back into
	 gcc/configure.in 
    <li> Need configure time switch to disable fast-fixinc.
  </ul>
  <li> Aligned stack slots for the x86.  1st of 2 patches installed (March 22).
       Need to do final review 2nd patch again and get it installed.
  <li> Fix EH vs loop unrolling problem.  The patch has been
       approved, but not yet installed.
  <li> Fix any bugs exposed by compiling glibc, linux-2.2.x and other
       major packages.  Major bughunting work.
  <li> Finish dealing with relative include paths and the ability
       to move toolchains around without rebuilding or -B arguments.
  <li> Issues for new targets (uwin, interix, hpux11, openbsd, etc?)
  <li> SMP build fixes (java & chill)
  <li> Testsuite legal issues need to be resolved.
  <li> Revamped install documentation.
  <li> dwarf2 based EH for ppc svr4 targets
  <li> rtl prologue/epilogue for ppc?
  <li> Cleanup of html docs provided with release
  <li> aliasing issues vs stack space for Fortran
  <li> sparc -fPIC problem
  <li> Resolve HJ's FCOMI stuff.
</ul>

<p> It may be the case that some of these items do not get addressed
for egcs-1.2, though we would like to get them all resolved.


<p>The tentative schedule for the egcs-1.2 release is:

<ul>
  <li> <b>April 21, 1999. Feature freeze date</b>.
  <p>All new features, optimizations, etc need to be <i>submitted</i> by
  this date.  It is likely that not all submissions will be accepted
  for egcs-1.2.  But all submissions need to be made available for evaluation
  by April 21, 1999.

  <p> We will try to get all accepted patches installed into the code base
  as quickly as possible after the feature freeze date.

  <p> After April 21, 1999, only bugfix submissions will be considered for
  the egcs-1.2 release.

  <p> By April 21, 1999, we also want to have a testing plan and release
  criteria in place.

  <p><li> <b>May 7, 1999. Branch Creation & Testing</b>.
  <p> The egcs-1.2 branch will be created on May 7, 1999 and snapshots will
  occur from the egcs-1.2 branch instead of the mainline sources.

  <p> By May 7, 1999 it is hoped that all new features, optimizations, etc
  slated for the egcs-1.2 release have been installed into the source tree.

  <p> Wide scale, release focused testing should start on or before May 7.

  <p> <li> <b>June 15, 1999. Critical Bug Freeze Date</b>.
  <p>June 15, 1999 is the target date for freezing the sources.  After this
  date only critical bugfixes will be accepted for inclusion in egcs-1.2.

  <p> <li> <b>July 1, 1999. Tenative Release date</b>.
  <p>July 1, 1999 is the target date for the actual release.  This may
  change based on testing status and other issues.  But we should shoot for
  July 1.
</ul>
</ul>


<p> We are also looking for one or more volunteers to help coordinate the
regression testing effort and major software testing.

<p> More information on regression testing, release criteria, new features
will hopefully start to appear soon as well as updated on the issues mentioned
in the list above.
