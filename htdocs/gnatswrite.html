<h1>Accessing the database</h1>

<p>In order to manage PRs, you need an account for our GNATS database
which is different from the authenticated access to the CVS repository
(though the username will be the same). If you do not have a GNATS
account yet (and think you should <CODE>;-)</CODE>) please contact
overseers@gcc.gnu.org.</p>

<p>Also, when you manage PRs, make sure mail-forwarding from
gcc.gnu.org to your normal email account is activated; otherwise
replies to status change notifications will bounce.</p>

<p>You can access the database either via <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl">gnatsweb</a>, or via
the gnatsd running on gcc.gnu.org.</p>

<h2>Using gnatsd and Emacs</h2>

<p>Check out GNATS v3 from
<code>:pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/gnats</code> by means of
the <code>-r gnats-v3-branch</code> option. Build and install that.</p>

<p>Add the the ../share/emacs/site-lisp/ directory installed by the GNATS
build to your <code>load-path</code> in order to pick up the gnats library.
</p>

<p>Finally, add the following entries to your <code>.emacs</code> file</p>

<blockquote><code>
  (load-library "gnats")<BR>
  (setq gnats:network-server "gcc.gnu.org")<BR>
  (setq gnats:userid "YourUserName")<BR>
  (setq gnats:password "YourGNATSPassword")<BR>
  (setq gnats:alias "gcc")<BR>
  (autoload 'edit-pr "gnats"
            "Command to edit a problem report." t)<BR>
  (autoload 'query-pr "gnats"
            "Command to query information about problem reports." t)
</code></blockquote>

<p>(If you already have PRMS support set up in you <code>.emacs</code>
file, remove that first, to avoid conflicts with duplicate symbols.)</p>


<h1>Adding Reports</h1>

<p>To add a new report, you should be familiar with the <a
href="gnats.html">general instructions</a>. In addition, you might
want to use the gccbug.el Emacs-Lisp file to aid putting forwarding
bug reports from gcc-bugs into the gnats database.</p>

<h1>Maintainer's View of Fields</h1>

<p>As a GCC-specific convention, we will attach a special meaning to
some fields. The State field should be used in the following way:</p>

<dl>

<dt>open</dt>
<dd>The PR has been filed and the responsible person(s) notified.</dd>

<dt>analyzed</dt>

<dd>A maintainer has verified that this is indeed a bug in GCC. Every
once in a while, old reports will need to be rechecked, to find out
whether the bug still exists. At that time, an indication should be
left in the report who tested the bug and when.</dd>

<dt>feedback</dt> 
<dd>The submitter was asked for further information, or asked to try
out a patch. The PR remains in that state until the submitter
responds.</dd>

<dt>suspended</dt>
<dd>Work on the problem has been postponed.  This happens if a timely
solution is not possible or is not cost-effective at the present time.
The PR continues to exist, though a solution is not being. actively
sought. If the problem cannot be solved at all, it should be closed
rather than suspended.</dd>

</dl>

<p>In addition, the <b>high</b> priority is reserved to maintainers in
GCC, indicating that a certain problem must be solved before the next
version of GCC is released.</p>
