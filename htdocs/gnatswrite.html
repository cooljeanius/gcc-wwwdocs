<title>Maintaining the GCC GNATS installation</title>
</head>

<h1>Accessing the database</h1>

<p>In order to manage PRs, you need an account on gcc.gnu.org, and a
GNATS password, which is different from the authenticated access to
the CVS repository. Also, when you manage PRs, make sure
mail-forwarding from gcc.gnu.org to your normal email account is
activated; otherwise replies to status change notifications will
bounce.</p>

<p>You can access the database either via <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.html">gnatsweb</a>, or via
the gnats running on gcc.gnu.org. Please check the gnats documentation
for the latter option.<p>

<h1>Adding Reports</h1>

<p>To add a new report, you should be familiar with the <a
href="gnats.html">general instructions</a>. In addition, you might
want to use the gccbug.el Emacs-Lisp file to aid putting forwarding
bug reports from gcc-bugs into the gnats database.</p>

<h1>Maintainer's View of Fields</h1>

<p>As a GCC-specific convention, we will attach a special meaning to
some fields. The State field should be used in the following way:</p>

<dl>

<dt>open</dt>
<dd>The PR has been filed and the responsible person(s) notified.</dd>

<dt>analyzed</dt>

<dd>A maintainer has verified that this is indeed a bug in GCC. Every
once in a while, old reports will need to be rechecked, to find out
whether the bug still exists. At that time, an indication should be
left in the report who tested the bug and when.</dd>

<dt>feedback</dt> 
<dd>The submitter was asked for further information, or asked to try
out a patch. The PR remains in that state until the submitter
responds.</dd>

<dt>suspended</dt>
<dd>Work on the problem has been postponed.  This happens if a timely
solution is not possible or is not cost-effective at the present time.
The PR continues to exist, though a solution is not being. actively
sought. If the problem cannot be solved at all, it should be closed
rather than suspended.</dd>

</dl>

<p>In addition, the <b>high</b> priority is reserved to maintainers in
GCC, indicating that a certain problem must be solved before the next
version of GCC is released.</p>
