<h1>GCC: About</h1>

<p>These pages are maintained by the GCC team, which consists of
numerous
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Contributors.html">volunteers
and contributors</a>.</p>

<p>The web effort was originally led by Jeff Law and later Gerald Pfeifer.
These days, Gerald and Janis Johnson maintain the web pages, but again,
there are <em>lots</em> of people who contribute.</p>

<p>The pages on gcc.gnu.org are updated "live" (that is, directly after
a change has been made); www.gnu.org is updated once a day at 4:00 -0700
(PDT).</p>

<p>Please send feedback, problem reports and patches to our
<a href="lists.html">mailing lists</a>.
</p>

<p>The web pages are under <a href="cvs.html">CVS control</a>. Changes
to the CVS repository immediately propagate to the web server and you
can easily track any changes or contribute some of your own.
</p>
