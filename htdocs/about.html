<h1 align="center">GCC: About</h1>

<p>These pages are maintained by the GCC team, which consists of
numerous <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/thanks.html">volunteers and
contributors</a>.
The web effort is coordinated by Jeff Law and Gerald Pfeifer, but again,
there are <em>lots</em> of people who contribute.</p>

<p>The pages on gcc.gnu.org are updated "live" (that is, directly after
a change has been made); www.gnu.org is updated once a day at 4:00 -0700
(PDT).</p>

<p>Please send feedback, problem reports and patches to our
<a href="lists.html">mailing lists</a>.
</p>

<p>Like the GCC sources themselves, the web pages are under
<a href="cvs.html">CVS control</a>. Changes to the CVS repository
immediately propagate to the web server and you can easily track any
changes or contribute some of your own.
</p>
