<h1>GCC: About</h1>

<p>These pages are maintained by the GCC team, which consists of
numerous
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Contributors.html">
contributors</a>.</p>

<p>The web effort was originally led by Jeff Law.  For the last decade
or so Gerald Pfeifer has been leading the effort, but again, there are
<em>lots</em> of people who contribute.</p>

<p>The web pages are under <a href="#cvs">CVS control</a> and you
can <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/wwwdocs/">browse
the repository</a> online.
The pages on gcc.gnu.org are updated "live" (that is, directly after a
change has been made); www.gnu.org is updated once a day at 4:00 -0700
(PDT).</p>

<p>Please send feedback, problem reports and patches to our
<a href="lists.html">mailing lists</a>.
</p>

<p>Want to contribute? Please check our <a href="projects/web.html">TODO list</a>!</p>

<h2 id="cvs">Using the CVS repository</h2>

<p>Assuming you have both CVS 
and SSH installed, you can check out the web pages as follows:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Set CVS_RSH in your environment to <code>ssh</code>.</li>
 <li><code>cvs -q -d :ext:<i>username</i>@gcc.gnu.org:/cvs/gcc checkout
-P wwwdocs</code> where <i>username</i> is your user name at gcc.gnu.org</li>
</ol>

<p>For anonymous access, use
<code>-d :pserver:cvs@gcc.gnu.org:/cvs/gcc</code> instead.</p>


<h3>Checking in a change</a></h3>

<p>The following is a very quick overview of how
to check in a change.  We recommend you list files explicitly
to avoid accidental checkins and prefer that each checkin be of a
complete, single logical change.</p>

<ol>
<li>Sync your sources with the master repository via "<code>cvs
update</code>".
This will also identify any files in your local
tree that you have modified.</li>

<li>We recommend reviewing the output of "<code>cvs diff</code>".</li>

<li>Use "<code>cvs commit</code>" to check in the patch.</li>

<li>Upon checkin a message will be sent to the gcc-cvs-wwwdocs mailing
list.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="system">The host system</h2>

<p>The setup of the machine running the gcc.gnu.org site is also
available, through
<a href="http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/?cvsroot=sourceware">
cvsweb</a> and anonymous read-only CVS.  Use the same procedure
as above, but use
<code>:pserver:anoncvs@gcc.gnu.org:/cvs/sourceware</code> for the
repository and <code>infra</code> for the module.</p>
