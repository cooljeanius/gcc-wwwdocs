<h2> XXX This is a template only.  It will change.</h2>
<p>July XX, 1999

<p>The GNU project and the GCC/EGCS developers are pleased to announce the
release of GCC version 2.95.  GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but
since the compiler supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands
for the GNU Compiler Collection.

<p>This is the first release of GCC since the April 1999 GCC/EGCS reunification
and includes nearly a year's worth of new development and bugfixes.

<p>The whole suite has been extensively 
<a href="regress.html">regression tested</a>
and <a href="othertest.html">package tested</a>.  It should be reliable
and suitable for widespread use.

<p>The compiler has several new optimizations, new targets, new languages
and other new features.  See the
<a href="features.html">new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features found in the GCC 2.95 releases.

<p>The sources include installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms in the <code>install</code> directory in the distribution.
However, the most up to date
 <a href="../install/index.html">installation instructions</a>
and <a href="buildstat.html">build/test status</a> are on the web pages.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.


<p> The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that
have contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc to GCC.  This
<a href="../thanks.html">amazing group of volunteers</a> is what makes GCC 
successful.

<p>And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using GCC 2.95.
