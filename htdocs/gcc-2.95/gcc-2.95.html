<h2> XXX This is a template only.  Anything beyond this point may be a lie</h2>
<p>Some date in the future.

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of gcc-2.95.

<p>EGCS is a free software project to further the development of the
GNU compilers using an open development environment.

<p>gcc-2.95 is a major new release of the egcs compiler system.  It has been
<a href="regress.html">extensively tested</a> and is believed to be
stable and suitable for widespread use.

<p>gcc-2.95 is based on an Sept 30, 1998 snapshot of the gcc-2.8 development
sources; it contains all of the new features found in gcc-2.8.1 as well as
all new development from gcc2 up to Sept 30, 1998.


<p>egcs also contains many improvements and features not found in gcc2 or
in older versions of egcs.
<ul>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="features.html">new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features found in gcc-2.95 releases.

<p>The gcc-2.95 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel directory
of the gcc-2.95 distribution).  However, we also keep the most up to date
<a href="../install/index.html">installation instructions </a>
and <a href="buildstat.html">build/test status</a> on our web page.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.

<p> The egcs project would like to thank the numerous people that have
contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc.  This 
<a href="../thanks.html">amazing group of volunteers</a> is what makes
egcs successful.

<p>And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using gcc-2.95.
