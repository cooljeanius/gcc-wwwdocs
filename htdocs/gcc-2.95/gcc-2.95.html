<h2> XXX This is a template only.  Anything beyond this point may be a lie</h2>
<p>Some date in the near future.

<p>The GCC project is pleased to announce the release of gcc-2.95.  gcc-2.95
represents the first release of the GNU Compiler Collection since the
April 1999 EGCS/GCC reunification.

<p>gcc-2.95 is a major release of the GNU Compiler Collection and includes
nearly a year of development and bugfixes.  It has been
<a href="regress.html">extensively tested</a> and is believed to be
stable and suitable for widespread use.

<p>See the <a href="features.html">new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features found in gcc-2.95 releases.

<p>The gcc-2.95 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms (see the install subdirectory in the gcc-2.95
 distribution).  However, we also keep the most up to date
<a href="../install/index.html">installation instructions</a>
and <a href="buildstat.html">build/test status</a> on our web page.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.

<p> The gcc project would like to thank the numerous people that have
contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc.  This 
<a href="../thanks.html">amazing group of volunteers</a> is what makes
gcc successful.

<p>And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using gcc-2.95.
