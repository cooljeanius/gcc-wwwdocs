<h1 align="center">GCC 2.95.3</h1>

<p>March 16, 2001

<p>The GNU project and the GCC developers are pleased to announce the
release of GCC version 2.95.3.  GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but
since the compiler supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands
for the GNU Compiler Collection.

<p>This is a minor release to address several bugs in the
<a href="gcc-2.95.2.html">GCC version 2.95.2 release</a>.

<p>
<ul>
  <li> Generic bugfixes and improvements
    <ul>
	<li>Fix numerous problems that caused incorrect optimization in the
	    register reloading code.
	<li>Fix numerous problems that caused incorrect optimization in the
	    loop optimizer.
	<li>Fix aborts in the functions build_insn_chain and scan_loops
	    under some circumstances.
	<li>Fix an alias analysis bug.
	<li>Fix an infinite compilation bug in the combiner.
	<li>A few problems with complex number support have been fixed.
	<li>It is no longer possible for gcc to act as a fork bomb when
	    installed incorrectly.
	<li>The -fpack-struct option should be recognized now.
	<li>Fixed a bug that caused incorrect code to be generated due to
	    a lost stack adjustment.
     </ul>
  <li>Platform specific bugfixes and improvements
    <ul>
	<li>Support building ARM toolchains hosted on Windows.
	<li>Fix attribute calculations in ARM toolchains.
	<li>arm-linux support has been improved.
	<li>Fix a PIC failure on sparc targets.
	<li>On ix86 targets, the regparm attribute should now work reliably.
	<li>Several updates for the h8300 port.
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>The whole suite has been extensively 
<a href="regress.html">regression tested</a>
and <a href="othertest.html">package tested</a>.  It should be reliable
and suitable for widespread use.

<p>The GCC 2.95 release has several new optimizations, new targets, new
languages and other new features as compared to EGCS 1.1 or GCC 2.8.  See
the <a href="features.html">new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features found in the GCC 2.95 releases.

<p>The sources include installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms in the <code>install</code> directory in the distribution.
However, the most up to date
 <a href="../install/index.html">installation instructions</a>
and <a href="buildstat.html">build/test status</a> are on the web pages.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.


<p> The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that
have contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc to GCC.  This
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/thanks.html">amazing group of volunteers</a> is
what makes GCC successful.

<p>And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using GCC 2.95.3.
