<h1>GCC 2.95.1 has not been released yet.  Please wait for the announcement.
This is the prototype announcement and will change.</h1>

<p>August 16, 1999

<p>The GNU project and the GCC/EGCS developers are pleased to announce the
release of GCC version 2.95.1.  GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but
since the compiler supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands
for the GNU Compiler Collection.

<p>This is a minor release to address several bugs in the GCC version 2.95
release.
<ul>
  <li> Generic bugfixes and improvements
    <ul>
	<li> Various documentation fixes related to the GCC/EGCS merger.
	<li> Fix memory management bug which could lead to spurious aborts, core
	     dumps or random parsing errors in the compiler.
  	<li> Fix a couple bugs in the dwarf dwarf2 debug record support.
	<li> Fix infinite loop in the CSE optimizer.
	<li> Avoid undefined behavior in compiler FP emulation code
	<li> Fix install problem when prefix is overridden on the make install
	     command.
	<li> Fix problem with unwanted installation of assert.h on some systems.
     </ul>
  <li> Platform specific bugfixes and improvements
    <ul>
	<li> Codegen bugfix for prologue/epilogue for cpu32 target.
	<li> Fix long long code generation bug for the Coldfire target.
	<li> Fix various aborts in the SH compiler.
	<li> Fix bugs in libgcc support library for the SH.
	<li> Fix sparc block profiling bug.
	<li> Fix alpha ev6 code generation bug.
	<li> Fix problems with EXIT_SUCCESS/EXIT_FAILURE redefinitions on AIX
	      platforms.
	<li> Fix -fpic code generation bug for rs6000/ppc svr4 targets.
 	<li> Fix varargs/stdarg code generation bug for rs6000/ppc svr4 targets.
	<li> Fix weak symbol handling for rs6000/ppc svr4 targets.
        <li> Fix codegen bug which cuased tetex to be mis-compiled on the x86
	<li> Fix compiler abort in new cfg code exposed by x86 port.
	<li> Fix out of range array reference in code convert flat
	     registers to the x87 stacked FP register file.
	<li> Fix minor vxworks configuration bug
    </ul>
  <li> Language & Runtime specific fixes.
    <ul>
	<li> Various C++ fixes FIXME?
	<li> Fix to prevent shared library version #s from bring truncated
	     to 1 digit
	<li> Fix missing std:: in the libstdc++ library.
	<li> Fix stream locking problems in libio.
	<li> Fix problem in java compiler driver.
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>The whole suite has been extensively 
<a href="regress.html">regression tested</a>
and <a href="othertest.html">package tested</a>.  It should be reliable
and suitable for widespread use.

<p>The compiler has several new optimizations, new targets, new languages
and other new features.  See the
<a href="features.html">new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features found in the GCC 2.95 releases.

<p>The sources include installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms in the <code>install</code> directory in the distribution.
However, the most up to date
 <a href="../install/index.html">installation instructions</a>
and <a href="buildstat.html">build/test status</a> are on the web pages.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.


<p> The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that
have contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc to GCC.  This
<a href="../thanks.html">amazing group of volunteers</a> is what makes GCC 
successful.

<p>And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using GCC 2.95.1.
