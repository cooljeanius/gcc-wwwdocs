<h1 align="center">GCC 2.95.2</h1>

<p>October 27, 1999

<p>The GNU project and the GCC developers are pleased to announce the
release of GCC version 2.95.2.  GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but
since the compiler supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands
for the GNU Compiler Collection.

<p>This is a minor release to address several bugs in the GCC version 2.95.1
release.

<p>The -fstrict-aliasing is not enabled by default for GCC 2.95.2.  While the
optimizations performed by -fstrict-aliasing are valid according to the C and
C++ standards, the optimization have caused some problems, particularly with
old non-conforming code.

<p>The GCC developers are experimenting with ways to warn users about code
which violates the C/C++ standards, but those warnings are not ready for
widespread use at this time.  Rather than wait for those warnings the GCC
developers have choosen to disable -fstrict-aliasing by default for the
GCC 2.95.2 release.

<p>We <b>strongly</b> encourage developers to find and fix code which violates
the C/C++ standards as -fstrict-aliasing may be enabled by default in future
releases.  Use the option -fstrict-aliasing to re-enable these optimizations.

<p>
<ul>
  <li> Generic bugfixes and improvements
    <ul>
	<li>Fix incorrectly optimized memory reference in global common
	    subexpression elimination (GCSE) optimization pass.
	<li>Fix code generation bug in regmove.c in which it could
	    incorrectly change a "const" value.
	<li>Fix bug in optimization of conditionals involving volatile
	    memory references.
	<li>Avoid over-allocation of stack space for some procedures.
	<li>Fixed bug in the compiler which caused incorrect optimization
	    of an obscure series of bit manipulations, shifts and arithmetic.
	<li>Fixed register allocator bug which caused teTeX to be mis-compiled
	    on Sparc targets.
	<li>Avoid incorrect optimization of degenerate case statements for
	    certain targets such as the ARM.
	<li>Fix out of range memory reference in the jump optimizer.
	<li>Avoid dereferencing null pointer in fix-header.
	<li>Fix test for GCC specific features so that it is possible
	    to bootstrap with gcc-2.6.2 and older versions of GCC.
	<li>Fix typo in scheduler which could potentially cause out of
	    range memory accesses.
	<li>Avoid incorrect loop reversal which caused incorrect code for
	    certain loops on PowerPC targets.
	<li>Avoid incorrect optimization of switch statements on certain
	    targets (for example the ARM).
     </ul>
  <li>Platform specific bugfixes and improvements
    <ul>
	<li>Work around bug in Sun V5.0 compilers which caused bootstrap
	    comparison failures on Sparc targets.
	<li>Fix Sparc backend bug which caused aborts in final.c.
	<li>Fix sparc-hal-solaris2* configuration fragments.
	<li>Fix bug in sparc block profiling.
	<li>Fix obscure code generation bug for the PARISC targets.
	<li>Define __STDC_EXT__ for HPUX configurations.
	<li>Various POWERPC64 code generation bugfixes.
	<li>Fix abort for PPC targets using ELF (ex GNU/Linux).
	<li>Fix collect2 problems for AIX targets.
	<li>Correct handling of .file directive for PPC targets.
	<li>Fix bug in fix_trunc x86 patterns.
	<li>Fix x86 port to correctly pop the FP stack for functions that
	    return structures in memory.
	<li>Fix minor bug in strlen x86 pattern.
	<li>Use stabs debugging instead of dwarf1 for x86-solaris targets.
	<li>Fix template repository code to handle leading underscore
	    in mangled names.
	<li>Fix weak/weak alias support for OpenBSD.
	<li>GNU/Linux for the ARM has C++ compatible include files.
    </ul>
  <li> Language & Runtime specific fixes.
    <ul>
	<li>Fix handling of constructor attribute in the C front-end
	    which caused problems building the Chill runtime library
	    on some targets.
	<li>Fix minor problem merging type qualifiers in the C front-end.
	<li>Fix aliasing bug for pointers and references (C/C++).
	<li>Fix incorrect "non-constant initializer bug" when
	    -traditional or -fwritable-strings is enabled.
	<li>Fix build error for Chill front-end on SunOS.
	<li>Do not complain about duplicate instantiations when using
	    -frepo (C++)
	<li>Fix array bounds handling in C++ front-end which caused
	    problems with dwarf debugging information in some circumstances.
	<li>Fix minor namespace problem.
	<li>Fix problem linking java programs.
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>The whole suite has been extensively 
<a href="regress.html">regression tested</a>
and <a href="othertest.html">package tested</a>.  It should be reliable
and suitable for widespread use.

<p>The GCC 2.95 release has several new optimizations, new targets, new
languages and other new features as compared to EGCS 1.1 or GCC 2.8.  See
the <a href="features.html">new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features found in the GCC 2.95 releases.

<p>The sources include installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms in the <code>install</code> directory in the distribution.
However, the most up to date
 <a href="../install/index.html">installation instructions</a>
and <a href="buildstat.html">build/test status</a> are on the web pages.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.


<p> The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that
have contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc to GCC.  This
<a href="../thanks.html">amazing group of volunteers</a> is what makes GCC 
successful.

<p>And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using GCC 2.95.2.
