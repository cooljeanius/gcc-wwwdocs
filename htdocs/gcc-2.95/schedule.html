<h1 align="center">GCC 2.95</h1>

<p> It was recently announced that the EGCS project would be taking over
maintenance of GCC.  To help reinforce this change in maintainership and
take one of the (many) steps needed to be the GCC maintainers the next
major release from the EGCS project will be GCC 2.95 (instead of EGCS 1.2).

<p> After GCC 2.95 is branched/released the remaining changes from the old FSF
gcc2 tree will be merged into the EGCS development tree and the old FSF gcc2
tree will be considered officially dead.  That way none of the work on the
old FSF gcc2 tree will be lost.  We chose not to merge in that code now 
because it would have introduced a significant delay in the GCC 2.95 release.

<p> We will start the GCC 3.0 release cycle once the remaining pieces of the new
C++ ABI and the libstdc++ rewrite are complete.  I also hope that we will have
an integrated Ada and/or Pascal compilers by then.


<p>This page is meant to provide information about the current schedule
for GCC 2.95, the <a href="regress.html">testing/release criteria</a>
for GCC 2.95, <a href="features.html">new features</a> to be found in
GCC 2.95, etc.

<p> We are still wrapping up some issues for the GCC 2.95 release.  We have
fallen somewhat behind the original schedule due to various reasons.  Hopefully
we will not have to slip the schedule further.

<p>The updated tentative schedule for the GCC 2.95 release is:

<ul>
  <li> <b>April 21, 1999. Feature freeze date</b>.
  <p>All new features, optimizations, etc need to be <i>submitted</i> by
  this date.  It is likely that not all submissions will be accepted
  for EGCS 1.2.  But all submissions need to be made available for evaluation
  by April 21, 1999.

  <p> We will try to get all accepted patches installed into the code base
  as quickly as possible after the feature freeze date.

  <p> After April 21, 1999, only bugfix submissions will be considered for
  the GCC 2.95 release.

  <p> By April 21, 1999, we also want to have a testing plan and release
  criteria in place.

  <p><li> <b>May 17, 1999. Branch Creation & Testing</b>.
  <p> The GCC 2.95 branch was created on May 17, 1999 and snapshots will
  occur from the GCC 2.95 branch instead of the mainline sources.  The
  <a href="branch.html">GCC 2.95 branch page</a> has information about
  how to check out the GCC 2.95 branch.

  <p> By May 17, 1999 it is hoped that all new features, optimizations, etc
  slated for the GCC 2.95 release have been installed into the source tree.

  <p> Wide scale, release focused testing should start on or before May 17.

  <p> <li> <b>June 22, 1999. Critical Bug Freeze Date</b>.
  <p>June 2, 1999 is updated the target date for freezing the sources.  After
  this date only critical bugfixes will be accepted for inclusion in GCC 2.95
  (original critical bugfreeze date was June 15, 1999).

  <p> <li> <b>July 8, 1999. Tenative Release date</b>.
  <p>July 8, 1999 is the updated target date for the actual release
  (original date was July 1, 1999).
</ul>
</ul>


<p> We are also looking for one or more volunteers to help coordinate the
regression testing effort and major software testing.

<p> More information on regression testing, release criteria, new features
will hopefully start to appear soon as well as updated on the issues mentioned
in the list above.
