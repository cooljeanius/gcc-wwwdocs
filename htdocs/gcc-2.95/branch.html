<h1 align="center">gcc-2.95 branch</h1>

<p>We have made a branch in the source tree for gcc-2.95.  Depending on your
situation you have three choices for handling your CVS tree.
<ol>
  <li> Do nothing.  Your existing CVS tree will continue to track the mainline
       egcs sources.
  <li> Track just the gcc-2.95 release.  You can convert your existing CVS tree
       to track the gcc-2.95 release with the command:
       <br><tt>cvs update -rgcc_2_95_branch</tt>
  <li> Track both the gcc-2.95 release and the development sources.  You will
       need to check out the gcc-2.95 release in a separate directory using the
       command:
       <br><tt>cvs co -rgcc_2_95_branch egcs</tt>
</ol>

<p>Considering that the primary focus of the project is on the gcc-2.95 release,
option #2 or #3 is recommended.

<p>FTP snapshots will track the gcc-2.95 release only.  After gcc-2.95 is
released, snapshots will return to tracking the mainline sources.

<hr>
<p>All patches for the gcc-2.95 release branch must be approved by either
someone with global write privs or that maintains the specific file being
patched.   At some point in the near future, all patches will need to go through
the release coordinator.  A message will be sent to the egcs list at that time.

<p>We are only accepting bugfix patches for the gcc-2.95 release.

<p>You can still submit patches for the mainline egcs sources.  However,
responses to such patches may be delayed.
