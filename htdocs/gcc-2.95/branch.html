<h1>GCC 2.95 branch</h1>

<p>We have made a branch in the source tree for GCC 2.95.  Depending on your
situation you have three choices for handling your CVS tree.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Do nothing.  Your existing CVS tree will continue to track the mainline
       gcc sources.</li>
  <li> Track just the GCC 2.95 release.  You can convert your existing CVS tree
       to track the GCC 2.95 release with the command:
       <br />
       <code>cvs update -rgcc-2_95-branch</code></li>
  <li> Track both the GCC 2.95 release and the development sources.  You will
       need to check out the GCC 2.95 release in a separate directory using the
       command:
       <br />
       <code>cvs co -rgcc-2_95-branch egcs</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Considering that the primary focus of the developers is on the GCC 2.95
release, option #2 or #3 is recommended.</p>

<p>FTP snapshots will track the GCC 2.95 release only.  After GCC 2.95 is
released, snapshots will return to tracking the mainline sources.</p>

<hr />
<p>All patches for the GCC 2.95 release branch must be approved by the
release coordinator (Jeff Law).</p>

<p>We are only accepting bugfix patches for the GCC 2.95 release.</p>

<p>You can still submit patches for the mainline GCC sources.  However,
responses to such patches may be delayed due to the focus on the GCC 2.95
release.</p>
