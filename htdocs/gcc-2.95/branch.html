<h1 align="center">gcc-2.95 branch</h1>

<p>We have made a branch in the source tree for gcc-2.95.  Depending on your
situation you have three choices for handling your CVS tree.
<ol>
  <li> Do nothing.  Your existing CVS tree will continue to track the mainline
       gcc sources.
  <li> Track just the gcc-2.95 release.  You can convert your existing CVS tree
       to track the gcc-2.95 release with the command:
       <br><tt>cvs update -rgcc-2_95-branch</tt>
  <li> Track both the gcc-2.95 release and the development sources.  You will
       need to check out the gcc-2.95 release in a separate directory using the
       command:
       <br><tt>cvs co -rgcc-2_95-branch egcs</tt>
</ol>

<p>Considering that the primary focus of the project is on the gcc-2.95 release,
option #2 or #3 is recommended.

<p>FTP snapshots will track the gcc-2.95 release only.  After gcc-2.95 is
released, snapshots will return to tracking the mainline sources.

<hr>
<p>All patches for the gcc-2.95 release branch must be approved by the
release coordinator (Jeff Law).

<p>We are only accepting bugfix patches for the gcc-2.95 release.

<p>You can still submit patches for the mainline gcc sources.  However,
responses to such patches may be delayed due to the focus on the gcc-2.95
release.
