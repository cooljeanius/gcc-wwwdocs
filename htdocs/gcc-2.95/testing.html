<h1>Testing GCC 2.95 with the current testsuite</h1>

<p>For the upcoming GCC 2.95.3 release, we need to perform tests on as many
platforms as possible to make sure we have no regressions from the previous
release.  We need volunteers to do these tests.  This document is an attempt
to provide a step-by-step walkthrough of what needs to be done.</p>

<p>You may want to read the <a href="../install/test.html">general
instructions for testing</a> first.  These describe some steps necessary
to set up the infrastructure needed to run the testsuite at all.</p>

<p>Once you have done that, proceed with these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>Download gcc-2.95.2 and the current testsuite:
<br /><a href="ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/gcc-2.95.2/gcc-2.95.2.tar.gz">
gcc-2.95.2.tar.gz</a>
<br /><a href="ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/snapshots/2000-11-27/gcc-tests-20001127.tar.gz">gcc-tests-20001127.tar.gz</a>
</li>

<li><p>Extract both, then move the testsuite into the right place:</p>
<blockquote><code>
  rm -rf gcc-2.95.2/gcc/testsuite<br />
  mv gcc-20001127/gcc/testsuite gcc-2.95.2/gcc/
</code></blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Change into the directory "<code>gcc-2.95.2/gcc/testsuite</code>"
and apply <a href="testsuite.diff">this patch</a> as follows:</p>
<blockquote><code>
  patch -p0 &lt;testsuite.diff
</code></blockquote>
</li>

<li>Build the 2.95.2 release on all available targets (using "<code>make
bootstrap</code>").
</li>

<li><p>Run the testsuite ("<code>make -k check</code>"), and send in
the results.  There's a script, "gcc-2.95.2/contrib/test_summary",
which will apparently help you postprocess those results into a usable
form.  If you run it like this (while in the toplevel build directory)</p>

<blockquote><code>
  gcc-2.95.2/contrib/test_summary | sh
</code></blockquote>

<p>it will automatically mail the results to the right place.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The same thing will then have to be done for the 2.95.3 test releases
which ought to start appearing shortly after Dec 17, 2000.  If you want,
you can already do tests on the current branch; the CVS branch tag is
"<code>gcc-2_95-branch</code>".
Don't forget to substitute the new testsuite on the branch as well.</p>
