<h1 align="center">gcc-2.95 Caveats</h1>

<ul>
  <li>gcc-2.95 has an integrated libstdc++, but does not have an integrated
  libg++.  Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work with gcc-2.95.  You can
  retrieve a recent copy of libg++ from the
  <a href="ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/infrastructure/libg++-2.8.1.3.tar.gz">  egcs ftp server</a>.
  <br>Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.

  <li> Exception handling may not work with shared libraries, particularly
  on alphas, hppas, rs6000/powerpc and mips based platforms.  Exception
  handling is known to work on x86-linux platforms with shared libraries.

  <li> Some versions of the Linux kernel have bugs which prevent them
  from being compiled or from running when compiled by gcc-2.95.  See
  <a href="../faq.html#linuxkernel">the FAQ</a> for additional information.

  <li> In general, gcc-2.95 is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++ code
  or deprecated C++ constructs than g++-2.7, g++-2.8, egcs-1.0, or egcs-1.1.
  As a result it may be necessary to fix C++ code before it will compile with
  gcc-2.95.

  <li>G++ is also converting toward the ISO C++ standard; as a result code
  which was previously valid (and thus accepted by other compilers and older
  versions of g++) may no longer be accepted.  The flag -fpermissive may
  allow some non-conforming code to compile with gcc-2.95.

  <li>gcc-2.95 compiled C++ code is not binary compatible with egcs-1.1,
  egcs-1.0.x or gcc-2.8.x.
</ul>
