<p>February 28, 1999

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of egcs-1.1.2.

<p>egcs is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers using
an open development model to accelerate development and testing of GNU
compilers and runtime libraries.

<p>egcs-1.1.2 is a minor update to the egcs-1.1.1 compiler to fix several
serious problems in egcs-1.1.1.

<ul>
  <li> General improvements and fixes
  <ul>
    <li> Fix bug in loop optimizer which caused the SPARC (and potentially
	 other) ports to segfault.

    <li> Fix infinite recursion in alias analysis and combiner code.

    <li> Fix bug in regclass preferencing which caused incorrect code
	 generation on the PowerPC and potentially elsewhere.

    <li> Fix incorrect loop reversal which caused incorrect code to
	 be generated for several targets.

    <li> Fix return value for builtin memcpy.

    <li> Reduce compile time for certain loops which exposed quadratic
	 behavior in the loop optimizer.

    <li> Fix bug which caused volatile memory to be written multiple
	 times when only one write was needed/desired.

    <li> Fix compiler abort in caller-save.c

    <li> Fix combiner bug which caused incorrect code generation for
	 certain division by constant operations.

    <li> Fix incorrect code generation due to a bug in range check
	 optimizations.

    <li> Fix incorrect code generation due to mis-handling of clobbered
	 values in CSE.

    <li> Fix compiler abort/segfault due to incorrect register
	 splitting when unrolling loops.

    <li> Fix code generation involving autoincremented addresses with
	 ternary operators.

    <li> Work around bug in the scheduler which caused qt to be mis-compiled
	 on some platforms.

    <li> Fix code generation problems with -fshort-enums.

    <li> Tighten security for temporary files.

  </ul>
  <li> Platform specific improvements and fixes
  <ul>
    <li> Fix detection of PPro/PII on Unixware 7.

    <li> Fix compiler segfault when building spec99 and other programs
	 for SPARC targets.

    <li> Fix code generation bugs for integer and floating point conditional	
	 move instructions on the PPro/PII.

    <li> Use fixincludes to fix byteorder problems on i?86-*-sysv.

    <li> Fix build failure for the arc port.

    <li> Fix floating point format configuration for i?86-gnu port

    <li> Fix problems with hppa1.0-hp-hpux10.20 configuration when
	 threads are enabled

    <li> Fix coldfire code generation bugs.

    <li> Fix "unrecognized insn" problems for Alpha and PPC ports.

    <li> Fix h8/300 code generation problem with floating point values
	 in memory.

    <li> Fix unrecognized insn problems for the m68k port.

    <li> Fix namespace pollution problem for the x86 port.

    <li> Fix problems with old assembler on x86 NeXT systems.

    <li> Fix PIC code generation problems for the SPARC port.

    <li> Fix minor bug with LONG_CALLS in PowerPC SVR4 support.

  </ul>
</ul>

<p>An important goal of egcs is to allow wide scale testing of new features
and optimizations which are still under development.  However, egcs has been
carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to most gcc releases.

<p>egcs-1.1.2 is based on the June 6, 1998 snapshot of the gcc-2.8 development
sources; it contains all of the new features found in gcc-2.8.1 as well as all
new development from gcc2 up to June 6, 1998.

<p>See the <a href="features.html">new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features found in egcs-1.1 releases.

<p>The egcs-1.1.2 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel directory
of the egcs-1.1.2 distribution).  However, we also keep the most up to date
<a href="../install/index.html">installation instructions</a>
and <a href="buildstat.html">build/test status</a> on our web page.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.

<p> The egcs project would like to thank the numerous people that have
contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc.  This 
<a href="../thanks.html">amazing group of volunteers</a> is what makes
egcs successful.

<p>And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using egcs-1.1.2.
