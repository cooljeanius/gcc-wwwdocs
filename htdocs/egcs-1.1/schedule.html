<h1>EGCS 1.1</h1>

<p>The EGCS project is rapidly approaching its second major release
(EGCS 1.1).

<p>This page is meant to provide information about the current schedule
for EGCS 1.1, the <a href="EGCS 1.1-test.html">testing/release criteria</a>
for EGCS 1.1, <a href="features.html">new features</a> to be found in
EGCS 1.1, etc.

<p> August 30, 1998.  Regression, libg++, glibc, linux kernel, rtems testing
all look good.  RedHat 5.1 testing looks good on the x86 and I've been told
that RedHat 5.1 testing on the Alpha looks good too.  No word on the SPARC
port.

<p> August 14, 1998.  The EGCS 1.1 sources are frozen.  Only critical patches
are being accepted.  All checkins to the EGCS 1.1 tree must be approved by
the release manager (law@cygnus.com).  We are shooting for an end of the month
release.

<p> July 14, 1998.  We have created the <a href="EGCS 1.1-branch.html">
EGCS 1.1 branch</a>. 

<p> July 7, 1998.  The <a href="EGCS 1.1-test.html">testing plan</a> is not
    ready yet, but we are actively working on solidifying the testing plan.

<p>The tentative schedule for the EGCS 1.1 release is:

<ul>
  <li> <b>July 3, 1998. Feature freeze date</b>.
  <p>All new features, optimizations, etc need to be <i>submitted</i> by
  this date.  It is very likely that not all submissions will be accepted
  for EGCS 1.1.  But all submissions need to be made available for evaluation
  by July 3, 1998.

  <p> It is also possible some patches which have been submitted and are
  accepted for EGCS 1.1 will not have been installed by this date due to
  EOQ commitments for many of the Cygnus volunteers.

  <p> After July 3, 1998, only bugfix submissions will be considered for
  the EGCS 1.1 release.

  <p> By July 3, 1998, we also want to have a testing plan and release
  criteria in place.

  <p><li> <b>July 11, 1998. Branch Creation & Testing</b>.
  <p> the EGCS 1.1 branch will be created on July 11, 1998 and snapshots will
  occur from the EGCS 1.1 branch instead of the mainline sources.

  <p> By July 11, 1998 it is hoped that all new features, optimizations, etc
  slated for the EGCS 1.1 release have been installed into the source tree.
  
  <p> Wide scale, focused testing should start on or before July 11th.

  <p> <li> <b>July 31, 1998. Critical Bug Freeze Date</b>.
  <p>July 31, 1998 is the target date for freezing the sources.  After this
  date only critical bugfixes will be accepted for inclusion in EGCS 1.1.
  This may be overly optimistic, but it's important to have a goal to shoot
  for.

</ul>

<p> The release should go out as soon as possible in early August.

<p> Note that we have the ability to install changes into the mainline
sources during this process.  However, the main focus will be on the EGCS 1.1
specific issues.

<p> It is highly likely that some minor releases will follow EGCS 1.1 (ie
EGCS 1.1.1, EGCS 1.1.2, etc).  So if a critical bug does not get fixed for
EGCS 1.1, it may be fixed in one of the minor releases.

<p> We plan to do a post-release review of the proposed schedule vs
the actual schedule used for EGCS 1.1 so that we can improve the process
in the future.
