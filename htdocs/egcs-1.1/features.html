<h1 align="center">egcs-1.1 new features</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Core compiler is based on the gcc2 development tree from June 9, 1998,
  so we have all of the <a href="../egcs-1.0/features-2.8.html"> features
  found in gcc-2.8</a>.
  <li>Integrated GNU Fortran compiler based on g77-0.5.24-19980804.
  <li>Vast improvements in the C++ compiler; so many they have 
  <a href="c++features.html">page of their own! </a>
  <li>Many improvements in the Fortran compiler; so many they have 
  <a href="fortran.html">page of their own! </a>
  <li>Compiler implements <a href="../gcse.html"> global common subexpression
  elimination and global copy/constant propagation. </a>
  <li>More major improvements in the <a href="../alias.html"> alias analysis
  code </a>.
  <li> More major improvements in the exception handling code to improve
  performance, lower static overhead and provide infrastructure for future
  improvements.
  <li> The infamous /tmp symlink race security problems have been fixed.
  <li> The regmove optimization pass has been nearly completely rewritten
  to improve performane of generated code.
  <li> The compiler now recomputes register usage information before local
  register allocation.  By providing more accurate information to the
  priority based allocator, we get better register allocation.
  <li> The register reloading phase of the compiler optimizes spill code
  much better than in previous releases.
  <li> Some bad interactions between the register allocator and instruction
  scheduler have been fixed, resulting in much better code for certain
  programs.  Additionally, we have tuned the scheduler in various ways to
  improve performance of generated code for some architectures.
  <li> The compiler's branch shorten algorithms have been significantly
  improved to work better on targets which align jump targets.
  <li> The compiler now implements the ADDRESSOF optimizations which can
  significantly reduce the overhead for certain inline function calls.
  <li> See the <a href="news.html"> NEWS file</a> for more improvements and
  further details.
</ul>
