<h1 align="center">EGCS 1.1</h1>

<p>September 3, 1998

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.1.

<p>EGCS is a free software project to further the development of the
GNU compilers using an open development environment.

<p>EGCS 1.1 is a major new release of the EGCS compiler system.  It has been
<a href="egcs-1.1-test.html">extensively tested</a> and is believed to be
stable and suitable for widespread use.

<p>EGCS 1.1 is based on an June 6, 1998 snapshot of the GCC 2.8 development
sources; it contains all of the new features found in GCC 2.8.1 as well as
all new development from GCC up to June 6, 1998.


<p>EGCS also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC or
in older versions of EGCS.
<ul>
  <li> Global common subexpression elimination and
  global constant/copy propagation (aka <a href="../news/gcse.html">gcse</a>)
  <li> Ongoing improvements to the <a href="../news/alias.html">alias analysis</a>
  support to allow for better optimizations throughout the compiler.
  <li> Vastly improved <a href="c++features.html">C++ compiler</a> and
  integrated C++ runtime libraries.
  <li> Fixes for the /tmp symlink race security problems.
  <li> New targets including mips16, arm-thumb and 64 bit PowerPC.
  <li> Improvements to GNU Fortran (<code>g77</code>) compiler and
  runtime library made since <code>g77</code> version 0.5.23.
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="features.html">new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features found in EGCS 1.1 releases.

<p>The EGCS 1.1 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel directory
of the EGCS 1.1 distribution).  However, we also keep the most up to date
<a href="../install/index.html">installation instructions </a>
and <a href="buildstat.html">build/test status</a> on our web page.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.

<p> The EGCS project would like to thank the numerous people that have
contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc.  This 
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/thanks.html">amazing group of volunteers</a>
is what makes EGCS successful.

<p>And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using EGCS 1.1.
