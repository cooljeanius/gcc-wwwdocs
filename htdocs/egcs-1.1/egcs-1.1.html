<h1 align="center">egcs-1.1</h1>

<p> This is the prototype announcement.  egcs-1.1 has not been released yet.
<p>XXX, 1998

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of egcs-1.1.

<p>egcs is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers using
an open development model to accelerate development and testing of GNU
compilers and runtime libraries.

<p>egcs-1.1 is a major new release of the egcs compiler system.  It has been
<a href="egcs-1.1-test.html"> extensively tested </a> and is believed to be
stable and suitable for widespread use.

<p>egcs-1.1 is based on an June 6, 1998 snapshot of the gcc-2.8 development
sources; it contains all of the new features found in gcc-2.8.1 as well as
all new development from gcc2 up to June 6, 1998.


<p>egcs also contains many improvements and features not found in gcc2 or
in older versions of egcs.
<ul>
  <li> Global common subexpression elimination and
  global constant/copy propagation (aka <a href="../gcse.html"> gcse</a>)
  <li> Ongoing improvements to the <a href="../alias.html"> alias analysis </a>
  support to allow for better optimizations throughout the compiler.
  <li> Integrated Fortran compiler and runtime libraries based on 
  <a href="fortran.html"> g77-0.5.24-19980804 </a>.
  <li> Vastly improved <a href="c++features.html"> C++ compiler</a> and
  integrated C++ runtime libraries.
  <li> Fixes for the /tmp symlink race security problems.
  <li> New targets including mips16, arm-thumb and 64 bit PowerPC.
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="features.html"> new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features found in egcs-1.1 releases.

<p>The egcs-1.1 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel directory
of the egcs-1.1 distribution).  However, we also keep the most up to date
<a href="../install/index.html"> installation instructions </a>
and <a href="buildstat.html"> build/test status </a> on our web page.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.

<p>And, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html"> caveats </a> to using egcs-1.1.

too numerous to mention by name.
