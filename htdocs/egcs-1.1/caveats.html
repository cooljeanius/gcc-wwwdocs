<h1 align="center">EGCS 1.1 Caveats</h1>

<ul>
  <li>EGCS has an integrated libstdc++, but does not have an integrated libg++.
  Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work with EGCS; HJ Lu has made a 
  <a href="ftp://ftp.yggdrasil.com/private/hjl/libg++-2.8.1.2.tar.gz">
  libg++ snapshot</a> available which may work with EGCS.
  <br>Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.

  <li> Exception handling may not work with shared libraries, particularly
  on alphas, hppas, rs6000/powerpc and mips based platforms.  Exception
  handling is known to work on x86-linux platforms with shared libraries.

  <li> Some versions of the Linux kernel have bugs which prevent them
  from being compiled or from running when compiled by EGCS.  See
  <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/fom_serv/cache/24.html">the FAQ</a>
  for additional information.

  <li> In general, EGCS is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++ code
  or deprecated C++ constructs than g++-2.7, g++-2.8 or EGCS 1.0.  As a result
  it may be necessary to fix C++ code before it will compile with EGCS.

  <li>G++ is also converting toward the ISO C++ standard; as a result code
  which was previously valid (and thus accepted by other compilers and older
  versions of g++) may no longer be accepted.

  <li>EGCS 1.1 compiled C++ code is not binary compatible with EGCS 1.0.x
  or GCC 2.8.x due to changes necessary to support thread safe exception
  handling.
</ul>
