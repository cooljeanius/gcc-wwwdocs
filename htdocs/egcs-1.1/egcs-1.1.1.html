<p>December 1, 1998

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.1.1.

<p>EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers using
an open development model to accelerate development and testing of GNU
compilers and runtime libraries.

<p>EGCS 1.1.1 is a minor update to the EGCS 1.1 compiler to fix several
serious problems in EGCS 1.1.

<ul>
  <li> General improvements and fixes
  <ul>
    <li> Avoid some stack overflows when compiling large functions.
    <li> Avoid incorrect loop invariant code motions.
    <li> Fix some core dumps on Linux kernel code.
    <li> Bring back the imake -Di386 and friends fix from EGCS 1.0.2.
    <li> Fix code generation problem in gcse.
    <li> Various documentation related fixes.
  </ul>
  <li> g++/libstdc++ improvements and fixes
  <ul>
    <li> MT safe EH fix for setjmp/longjmp based exception handling.
    <li> Fix a few bad interactions between optimization and exception handling.
    <li> Fixes for demangling of template names starting with "__".
    <li> Fix a bug that would fail to run destructors in some cases with -O2.
    <li> Fix 'new' of classes with virtual bases.
    <li> Fix crash building Qt on the Alpha.
    <li> Fix failure compiling WIFEXITED macro on GNU/Linux.
    <li> Fix some -frepo failures.

  </ul>
  <li> g77 and libf2c improvements and fixes
  <ul>
    <li> Various documentation fixes.
    <li> Avoid compiler crash on RAND intrinsic.
    <li> Fix minor bugs in makefiles exposed by BSD make programs.
    <li> Define _XOPEN_SOURCE for libI77 build to avoid potential
         problems on some 64-bit systems.
    <li> Fix problem with implicit endfile on rewind.
    <li> Fix spurious recursive I/O errors.
  </ul>
  <li> platform specific improvements and fixes
  <ul>
    <li> Match all versions of UnixWare7.
    <li> Do not assume x86 SVR4 or UnixWare targets can handle stabs
    <li> Fix PPC/RS6000 LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS macro and bug in conversion
    from unsigned ints to double precision floats.
    <li> Fix ARM ABI issue with NetBSD.
    <li> Fix a few arm code generation bugs.
    <li> Fixincludes will fix additional broken SCO OpenServer header files.
    <li> Fix a m68k backend bug which caused invalid offsets in reg+d addresses.
    <li> Fix problems with 64bit AIX 4.3 support.
    <li> Fix handling of long longs for varargs/stdarg functions on the ppc.
    <li> Minor fixes to CPP predefines for Windows.
    <li> Fix code generation problems with gpr<->fpr copies for 64bit ppc
    <li> Fix a few coldfire code generation bugs.
    <li> Fix some more header file problems on SunOS 4.x
    <li> Fix assert.h handling for RTEMS.
    <li> Fix Windows handling of TREE_SYMBOL_REFERENCED.
    <li> Fix x86 compiler abort in reg-stack pass.
    <li> Fix cygwin/windows problem with section attributes.
    <li> Fix Alpha code generation problem exposed by SMP Linux kernels.
    <li> Fix typo in m68k 32->64bit integer conversion.
    <li> Make sure target libraries build with -fPIC for PPC & Alpha targets.
  </ul>
</ul>


<p>An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of new features
and optimizations which are still under development.  However, EGCS has been
carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to most gcc releases.

<p>EGCS 1.1.1 is based on the June 6, 1998 snapshot of the GCC 2.8 development
sources; it contains all of the new features found in GCC 2.8.1 as well as all
new development from gcc2 up to June 6, 1998.

<p>See the <a href="features.html">new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features found in EGCS 1.1 releases.

<p>The EGCS 1.1.1 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel directory
of the EGCS 1.1.1 distribution).  However, we also keep the most up to date
<a href="../install/index.html">installation instructions</a>
and <a href="buildstat.html">build/test status</a> on our web page.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.

<p> The EGCS project would like to thank the numerous people that have
contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc.  This 
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/thanks.html">amazing group of volunteers </a>
is what makes EGCS successful.

<p>And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using EGCS 1.1.1.
