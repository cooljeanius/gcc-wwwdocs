<h1>GCC 14 Release Series</h1>

<p>As of this time no releases of GCC 14 have yet been made.</p>

<h2>References and Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
GNU Compiler Collection.</p>

<p>The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that have
contributed new features, improvements, bug fixes, and other changes as
well as test results to GCC.
This <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-14.1.0/gcc/Contributors.html">amazing
group of volunteers</a> is what makes GCC successful.</p>
