<h1 align="center">egcs-1.1 regression test strategy</h1>

<p>We are still hammering out the final testing plan for egcs-1.1; however
some of the work can be started before the final testing plan is finished.

<p>One of the critical steps in making releases is regression testing.  For
egcs-1.1 we want to perform regression tests against gcc-2.8.1 and 
egcs-1.0.3a.

<p>So, we are looking for volunteers to run the egcs testsuite using 
gcc-2.8.1 and egcs-1.0.3a and eventually the egcs-1.1 snapshots.

<p>Since it is impossible to test every platform, we have selected a list
of popular platforms for which egcs-1.1 should have no regressions relative
to egcs-1.0.3a or gcc-2.8.1.

<p>We encourage testing of platforms not on the official regression test
list.  However, the "no regressions" policy does not necessarily apply
to targets not on the official regression test list.


<p>This list is not yet complete.  However, the targets currently on the
list will not be removed from the list.  So we can start gathering test
results for these platforms now.

<ul>
<li>alpha-dec-osf4
<li>alpha-dec-linux (glibc2, presumably this implies Red Hat 5.0 or 5.1)
<li>hppa1.1-hp-hpux10.20
<li>mips-sgi-irix5.?
<li>mips-sgi-irix6.2
<li>{powerpc,rs6000}-ibm-aix4.1
<li>sparc-sun-solaris2.5
<li>sparc-sun-solaris2.6
<li>sparc-sun-sunos4.1.4
<li>sparc-sun-linux
<li>x86-pc-linux-gnulibc1
<li>x86-pc-linux-gnu  (glibc2)
</ul>

<p>Contact <a href="mailto:law@cygnus.com">law@cygnus.com</a> directly if you
want to help with the regression testing phase of the egcs-1.1 release cycle.

<p>We would like to add one or two targets which use free operating systems 
like FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, etc.  We would also like to add a m68k
native target (NeXT and/or NetBSD most likely) and a non-linux x86 target.
We will probably another AIX target to the official list.  Your comments
and suggestions for these last few test targets would be appreciated.


<h2>How to run the regression tests</h2>

<p>  First, you must get out of the egcs object directory.  So change 
     directories into your home directory, /tmp or somewhere else.

<p>  Second, you need an appropriate site.exp.  Here is a template:

<pre>
  set rootme "."
  set srcdir "/foo/egcs/gcc"
  set target_triplet hppa1.1-hp-hpux10.20
  set tmpdir /tmp
  set srcdir "${srcdir}/testsuite"
  set GCC_UNDER_TEST /foo/bar/com/gcc
  set GXX_UNDER_TEST /foo/bar/com/g++
</pre>


<p>  Obviously you have to change "srcdir" to the directory where your
  egcs/gcc sources are located.

<p>  You should set target_triplet to the canonical name of your system.
  Running "config.guess" from the toplevel egcs source directory  will
  tell you the canonical name of your system.

<p>  Set GCC_UNDER_TEST and CXX_UNDER_TEST to the fully qualified pathname
  to a gcc-2.7.2.* version of gcc & g++.

<p>Then run the tests with the following commands:

<pre>
  runtest --tool gcc
  runtest --tool g++
  runtest --tool g77 (Only necessary if you have installed g77)
</pre>


<p>This will create "gcc.sum", "g++.sum" and "g77.sum".  You should send
those files to the testing coordinator <a href="mailto:law@cygnus.com">
law@cygnus.com</a>.
