Welcome to the egcs project!

<p>egcs is an experimental step in the development of GCC, the GNU C
compiler.  If you are new to the egcs project, you should probably read
the <a href="mission.html"> egcs mission statement </a>.

<p>We want to work closely with contributors to help and encourage
them to submit their changes for inclusion in egcs. We make regular <a
href="#snapshots">snapshots</a> publicly available. We provide <a
href="cvs.html">readonly access via remote-CVS</a> to anyone on the
net, and <a href="cvswrite.html">read-write access</a> to certain
external developers in the manner already used in other Free Software
projects on the net.  All code continues to be <a
href="contribute.html">assigned to the FSF</a> exactly as before and
is available to the gcc2 maintainers for ultimate inclusion into the
gcc2 tree.

<p>We will provide regular, high quality <a href="#releases">releases</a>.
We want those releases to work well on a variety of native (including linux)
and cross targets and use an extensive <a href="testresults/">test
suite</a> as well as a <a href="benchresults/">benchmark suite</a> to
maintain and improve quality.
<a href="egcs-1.1/egcs-1.1.1.html"> egcs-1.1.1</a> is the current release.

<p>egcs is pronounced "eggs", the c is silent.
