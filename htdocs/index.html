<h1><small>Welcome to the GCC home page!</small></h1>

<p>GCC is the GNU Compiler Collection, which currently contains
front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran,
<a href="java/">Java</a>, and Ada, as well as libraries for these
languages (<a href="libstdc++/">libstdc++</a>, libgcj,...).</p>

<p>Major decisions about GCC are made by the <a href="steering.html">
steering committee</a>, guided by the <a href="gccmission.html">
mission statement</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage everyone to <a href="contribute.html">contribute changes</a>
and help testing GCC, and we provide access to our development sources with
<a href="cvs.html">anonymous CVS</a> and <a href="snapshots.html">weekly
snapshots</a>.</p>

<p>We strive to provide regular, high quality
<a href="releases.html">releases</a>, which we want to work well on a variety
of native (including GNU/Linux) and cross targets.
To that end, we use an extensive <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/testing/">test
suite and automated regression testers</a> as well
as <a href="benchmarks/">various benchmark suites and automated testers</a>
to maintain and improve quality.</p>

<dt><b>January 29, 2003</b></dt>

<dd>
Andrew Haley of Red Hat completed the work begun by Bo Thorsen of SuSE
to port <a href="java/">GCJ</a> to the AMD x86-64
architecture.  This is the first implementation of the Java
programming language to be made available on that platform.  It will
be part of the GCC 3.3 release.
</dd>

<dt><b>January 28, 2003</b></dt>
<dd>
The ongoing effort to remove warnings from the GCC code base itself,
spear-headed by Kaveh Ghazi, has paid off: For our development versions
and snapshots, we now enable <code>-Werror</code> during a full bootstrap.
</dd>

<dt><b>January 22, 2003</b></dt>
<dd>
The GCC Steering Committee has named Gabriel Dos Reis as release manager for
the upcoming GCC 3.2.2 release, allowing Mark Mitchell to focus his
efforts on the GCC 3.3 and 3.4 releases.  3.2.2 is intended to be a bug
fix release only.
</dd>

<dt><b>January 10, 2003</b></dt>
<dd>
Geoffrey Keating of Apple Computer, Inc., with support from Red Hat,
Inc., has contributed a
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Precompiled-Headers.html#Precompiled%20Headers">
precompiled header</a> implementation that can dramatically speed up
compilation of some projects.
</dd>

<dt><b>December 27, 2002</b></dt>
<dd>
Mark Mitchell of CodeSourcery has contributed a
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2000-10/msg00573.html">new, hand-crafted
recursive-descent C++ parser</a> sponsored by the Los Alamos National
Laboratory.  The new parser is more standard conforming and fixes many bugs
(about 100 in our bug database alone) from the old YACC-derived parser.
</dd>

<dt><b>December 4, 2002</b></dt>
<dd>
Nathan Sidwell of CodeSourcery has contributed an <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2002-11/msg01858.html">implementation of
non-trivial covariant returns for non-varadic virtual functions</a>.
</dd>

<dt><b>November 21, 2002</b></dt>
<dd>
<a href="gcc-3.2/">GCC 3.2.1</a> has been released.  We plan to shortly
create the GCC 3.3 release branch (but want to fix a couple of high-priority
regressions first).
