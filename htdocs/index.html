<h2>Welcome to the GCC home page!</h2>

<p>In April 1999, the egcs steering committee was appointed by the FSF
as the official GNU maintainer for GCC.  At that time GCC was renamed
from the "GNU C Compiler" to the "GNU Compiler Collection".

<p>As a result of those changes the project has a new
<a href="gccmission.html">mission statement</a> which more accurately
reflects the fundamental goals of the project.

<p>We want to work closely with contributors to help and encourage
them to submit their changes for inclusion in GCC.  We thus provide
access to our <a href="#development_sources">development sources</a>
with weekly snapshots and anonymous CVS.  All code continues to be <a
href="contribute.html">assigned to the FSF</a> exactly as before.</p>

<p>We will provide regular, high quality 
<a href="ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/releases/index.html">releases</a>.
We want those releases to work well on a variety of native (including
GNU/Linux) and cross targets and use an extensive
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/testresults/">test suite</a> as well as a
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/benchresults/">benchmark suite</a> to
maintain and improve quality.
<a href="gcc-2.95/gcc-2.95.2.html">GCC 2.95.2</a> is the current release.

<h2>News/Announcements</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>May 2, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Stan Cox and Jason Eckhardt of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have
contributed a <a href="news/reorder.html">basic block reordering pass</a>.
The optimization can
reposition basic blocks from across the entire function in an attempt
to reduce branch penalties and enhance instruction cache efficiency.
<p>
Our thanks go to Michael Hayes, Jan Hubicka, and Graham Stott who
noticed or fixed defects or made other useful suggestions.
</dd>

<dt><b>May 1, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Richard Earnshaw of ARM Ltd, and Nick Clifton of Cygnus, a Red Hat
company, have contributed a new backend for the Arm and Thumb
processors. 
<p>
The new backend combines code generation for the Arm, the Thumb and
the StrongArm into one compiler, with the target processor and
instruction sets being selectable via command line switches.
</dd>

<dt><b>April 30, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Michael Meissner and Nick Clifton of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have
contributed a port for the Mitsubishi D30V processor.
<p>
Michael Meissner and Richard Henderson of Cygnus, a Red Hat company,
have contributed a new if-conversion pass.  The code runs faster and
identifies more optimization opportunities than the old code.  In
addition, it also has support for conditional (predicated) execution,
such as is found in the Intel IA-64 architecture, the ARM processors,
and numerous embedded LIW and DSP parts.
</dd>

<dt><b>March 22, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
The Steering Committee has appointed Mark Mitchell, of <a
href="http://www.codesourcery.com">CodeSourcery, LLC</a>, to manage the
GCC 3.0 release and as a new Steering Committe member.
CodeSourcery will be providing time from Mark, Alex Samuel, and other
personnel, to manage the release.  Thanks!
<p>
The Steering Committee and the GCC community owe Jeff Law an immense
debt for his work as release manager for the EGCS 1.0.x, 1.1.x, and
GCC 2.95.x series of releases.  He has done an outstanding job.
</dd>

<dt><b>March 18, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Andy Vaught has started work on GNU Fortran 95, the Fortran
Frontend destined to implement the latest standard.  See
<a href="http://g95.sourceforge.net/">this page</a> for its current
status (previously over <a href="http://xena.eas.asu.edu/~andy/">here</a>).
</dd>

<dt><b>March 17, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Jim Wilson and Richard Henderson of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, and
David Mosberger of HP labs have
contributed a port for the Intel Itanium (aka IA-64) processor.
<br><br>
Jeff Law and Richard Henderson of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have contributed
RTL based tail call elimination optimizations.  Support currently exists for
the Alpha, HPPA, ia32 and MIPS processors.  Long term the RTL based
tail call optimizations will be replaced with a tree based tail call
optimizer.
</dd>

<dt><b>March 14, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
CodeSourcery, LLC is now providing nightly <a
href="http://www.codesourcery.com/gcc-snapshots.html">snapshots of
GCC</a>, distributed as RPMs for GNU/Linux on Intel platforms, plus
build logs and testsuite results.  In order to allow users to more
easily confirm whether the current snapshot of GCC fixes a particular
bug, an online compilation <a
href="http://www.codesourcery.com/gcc-compile.html">web form</a> is
provided.
</dd>

<dt><b>March 13, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Denis Chertykov contributed an AVR port.
AVR is a family of micro controllers made by Atmel with embedded FLASH
program memory and embedded RAM.  It is the first GCC port to an 8-bit
microprocessor with a 16-bit address bus.
</dd>

<dt><b>March 9, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
CodeSourcery, LLC and Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have contributed an
implementation of <a href="news/ssa.html">static single assignment</a>
(SSA) representation.  SSA will facilitate the implementation of
powerful code optimizations in GCC.
</dd>

<dt><b>March 2, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Jason Molenda, who had a major role in setting up and managing the
gcc.gnu.org (originally egcs.cygnus.com) machine and site, is leaving
Cygnus. We would like to thank him for his efforts and support behind
the scenes and wish Jason all the best in his new job.
