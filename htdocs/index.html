Welcome to the egcs project!

<p>egcs is an experimental step in the development of GCC, the GNU C
compiler.  If you are new to the egcs project, you should probably read
the <a href="mission.html"> egcs mission statement </a>.

<p>We want to work closely with contributors to help and encourage
them to submit their changes for inclusion in egcs. We make regular <a
href="#snapshots">snapshots</a> publicly available. We provide <a
href="cvs.html"> readonly access via remote-CVS </a> to anyone on the
net, and read-write access to certain external developers in the
manner already used in other Free Software projects on the net.  All
code continues to be <a href="contribute.html">assigned to the FSF</a>
exactly as before and is available to the gcc2 maintainers for
ultimate inclusion into the gcc2 tree.

<p>We will provide regular, high quality <a
href="#releases">releases</a>. We want those releases to work well on
a variety of native (including linux) and cross targets.  <a
href="egcs-1.1/egcs-1.1.1.html"> egcs-1.1.1</a> is the current release.

<p>egcs is pronounced "eggs", the c is silent.

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>Got questions about egcs?  Here is <a href="faq.html">our attempt at
answering some of them</a>.  We'll add more later.

<h2>Mailing Lists</h2>

<p>Want to read about egcs development or post messages to the egcs
lists?  All the information you need to access the <a href="lists.html">
mailing lists </a> can be found here. 

<h2><a name=snapshots>Snapshots</a></h2>

<p>Snapshots are generated weekly and put up for ftp.  If you are going
to mess with snapshots, you should definitely be subscribed to the
<tt>egcs</tt> mailing list.

<p>The snapshots are available from
<a href="ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/snapshots/index.html">
egcs.cygnus.com:/pub/egcs/snapshots</a>.

<p>Note at times you may find newer directories on the server with limited
permissions.  These represent snapshots that have not yet been verified
as correct, or are known to be incorrect.

<p>When a particular snapshot is ready for public consumption the directory
permissions are relaxed, the LATEST-IS- file is updated and a message is
sent to the egcs list.

<p>Using a snapshot before it's officially made available is an unwise thing
to do since it may become impossible to update to an official snapshot.

<h2><a name="releases">Releases</a></h2>

<p>Releases are available from <a
href="ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/releases/index.html">
egcs.cygnus.com:/pub/egcs/releases</a>.

<h2><a name="mirrors">Mirror Sites</a></h2>

<p>Several sites around the world mirror our FTP server.  When downloading
release or snapshots, please try to select an appropriate 
<a href="mirrors.html"> mirror site</a>. 

<h2><a name="thanks">Acknowledgements</a></h2>

<p> No project of this size can be successful without contributions from
numerous folks.  We have compiled a <a href="thanks.html"> partial list of
contributors.</a>

<h2><a name="contributions">Contributions</a></h2>
<p>We encourage contributions of code, bugfixes, new optimizations, new
features, documentation updates, web page improvements, etc.

There are certain 
<a href="contribute.html"> legal requirements and style issues </a>
which all contributions must meet.
