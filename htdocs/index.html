Welcome to the egcs project!

<p>egcs is an experimental step in the development of GCC, the GNU C
compiler.  If you are new to the egcs project, you should probably read
the <a href="mission.html">egcs mission statement </a>.

<p>We want to work closely with contributors to help and encourage
them to submit their changes for inclusion in egcs.  The egcs project
provides access to its <a href="#development_sources">development sources</a>
with weekly snapshots and anonymous CVS.  All code continues to be <a
href="contribute.html">assigned to the FSF</a> exactly as before and
is available to the gcc2 maintainers for ultimate inclusion into the
gcc2 tree.

<p>We will provide regular, high quality <a href="#releases">releases</a>.
We want those releases to work well on a variety of native (including
GNU/Linux) and cross targets and use an extensive <a href="testresults/">test
suite</a> as well as a <a href="benchresults/">benchmark suite</a> to
maintain and improve quality.
<a href="egcs-1.1/egcs-1.1.1.html">egcs-1.1.1</a> is the current release.

<p>egcs is pronounced "eggs", the c is silent.
