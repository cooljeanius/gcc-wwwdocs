<h2>Welcome to the egcs project!</h2>

In April 1999, the egcs steering committee was appointed by the FSF
as the official GNU maintainer for GCC.  At that time GCC was renamed
from the "GNU C Compiler" to the "GNU Compiler Collection".

<p>As a result of those changes the project has a new
<a href="gccmission.html">mission statement</a> which more accurately
reflects the fundamental goals of the egcs project.

<p>We want to work closely with contributors to help and encourage
them to submit their changes for inclusion in egcs.  The egcs project
provides access to its <a href="#development_sources">development sources</a>
with weekly snapshots and anonymous CVS.  All code continues to be <a
href="contribute.html">assigned to the FSF</a> exactly as before.</p>

<p>We will provide regular, high quality 
<a href="ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/releases/index.html">releases</a>.
We want those releases to work well on a variety of native (including
GNU/Linux) and cross targets and use an extensive <a href="testresults/">test
suite</a> as well as a <a href="benchresults/">benchmark suite</a> to
maintain and improve quality.
<a href="egcs-1.1/egcs-1.1.2.html">egcs-1.1.2</a> is the current release.
<a href="gcc-2.95/gcc-2.95.html">gcc-2.95</a> is the next major release.

<dt><b>June 15, 1999</b></dt>

<dt><b>May 27, 1999</b></dt>

Toon Moene has emailed (and posted) his notes on
the GNU Fortran (<code>g77</code>) Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) session at <a
href="http://www.linuxexpo.org/">LinuxExpo</a>
to the appropriate lists,
and Craig Burley has made Toon's notes available (in edited form) at <a
href="http://world.std.com/~burley/bof.html">http://world.std.com/~burley/bof.html</a>.

<br>Probably the most important decision reached at the meeting
is that Craig Burley will undertake the long-awaited <q>0.6 rewrite</q>
of the <code>g77</code> front end as his top priority for
the <code>gcc</code> 3.0 release,
rather than focusing on implementing some of the <q>most wanted</q>
features that didn't require the rewrite,
such as Cray pointers.

<br>The BOF provided us with
some additional information to guide future development of
GNU Fortran.
Thanks to all who attended, whether in person or in spirit!

<dt><b>May 18, 1999</b></dt>
<dd>
The sixth snapshot of the ongoing re-written C++ Standard Library has
been released.  It includes SGI STL 3.2, an automatically generated
<code>&lt;limits&gt;</code>, a partially re-written valarray, a working
stringbuf and stringstream (for basic types). For more informtaion,
please check <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/libstdc++/">
libstdc++-2.90.5</a>. 
</dd>
<dt><b>April 23, 1999</b></dt>
<dd>
<code>g77</code> now supports optional run-time checking
of array subscript expressions
via the <code>-fbounds-check</code> compiler option.
(The same option applies to whatever bounds-checking
applies for other languages, such as Java.
The <code>-ffortran-bounds-check</code> option specifies
bounds-checking for Fortran code.)
