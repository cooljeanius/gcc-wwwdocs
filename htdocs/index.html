Welcome to the egcs project!

<p>egcs is an experimental step in the development of GCC, the GNU C
compiler.

<p>A bunch of us (including Fortran, Linux, Intel and RTEMS hackers)
have gotten together to return to the fundamental idea that code
visibility and submissions from the net are vital to the long term
improvement of the compiler.  We are integrating variations and
patches to GCC that are floating around, including some front-ends
like g77 (Fortran).  We are going to work closely with the free OS'es
(e.g.  Linux, *BSD) where GCC is a critical piece of infrastructure.
We invite you to join us.

<p>We want to work closely with contributors to help and encourage
them to submit their changes for inclusion in egcs. We make regular <a
href="#snapshots">snapshots</a> publicly available. We provide <a
href="cvs.html"> readonly access via remote-CVS </a> to anyone on the
net, and read-write access to certain external developers in the
manner already used in other Free Software projects on the net.  All
code continues to be <a href="contribute.html">assigned to the FSF</a>
exactly as before and is available to the gcc2 maintainers for
ultimate inclusion into the gcc2 tree.

<p>We will provide regular, high quality <a
href="#releases">releases</a>. We want those releases to work well on
a variety of native (including linux) and cross targets.  <a
href="egcs-1.0.3.html"> egcs-1.0.3</a> is the current release.
<a href="egcs-1.1.html"> egcs-1.1</a> is the upcoming release.

<p>egcs is pronounced "eggs", the c is silent.

  We have added two new mailing lists for the egcs project.
  <b>egcs-cvs</b> and <b>egcs-patches</b>.

  <p>When a patch is checked into the CVS repository, a check-in notification
  message is automatically sent to the <b>egcs-cvs</b> mailing list.  This will
  allow developers to monitor changes as they are made.

  <p>Patch submissions should be sent to <b>egcs-patches</b> instead of the
  main egcs list.  This is primarily to help ensure that patch submissions do
  not get lost in the large volume of the main mailing list.

  Stanford has volunteered to host a high speed mirror for egcs.  This
  should significantly improve download speeds for releases and snapshots.
  Thanks Stanford and Tobin Brockett for the use of their network, disks
  and computing facilities!

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p>Got questions about egcs?  Here is <a href="faq.html">our attempt at
answering some of them</a>.  We'll add more later.

<h2>MAILING LISTS</h2>

<p>Want to read about egcs development or post messages to the egcs
lists?  All the information you need to access the <a href="lists.html">
mailing lists </a> can be found here. 

<h2><a name=snapshots>SNAPSHOTS</a></h2>

<p>Snapshots are generated weekly and put up for ftp.  If you are going
to mess with snapshots, you should definitely be subscribed to the
<tt>egcs</tt> mailing list.

<p>The snapshots are available from
<a href="ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/snapshots/index.html">
egcs.cygnus.com:/pub/egcs/snapshots</a>.

<p>Note at times you may find newer directories on the server with limited
permissions.  These represent snapshots that have not yet been verified
as correct, or are known to be incorrect.

<p>When a particular snapshot is ready for public consumption the directory
permissions are relaxed, the LATEST-IS- file is updated and a message is
sent to the egcs list.

<p>Using a snapshot before it's officially made available is an unwise thing
to do since it may become impossible to update to an official snapshot.

<h2><a name="releases">RELEASES</a></h2>

<p>Releases are available from <a
href="ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/releases/index.html">
egcs.cygnus.com:/pub/egcs/releases</a>.

<h2><a name="mirrors">MIRROR LISTS</a></h2>

<p> Several sites around the world mirror our FTP server.  When downloading
release or snapshots, please try to select an appropriate 
<a href="mirrors.html"> mirror site</a>. 

<hr>
<p>We encourage contributions of code, bugfixes, new optimizations, new
features, documentation updates, web page improvements, etc.  Look
<a href="contribute.html">here</a> for information about contributing
to the egcs project.
