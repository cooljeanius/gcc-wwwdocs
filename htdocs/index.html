<h2>Welcome to the GCC home page!</h2>

<p>If you were looking for the EGCS project, you found the right place;
GCC development is now reunited and the former egcs team is now
responsible for GCC releases.

<p>In April 1999, the egcs steering committee was appointed by the FSF
as the official GNU maintainer for GCC.  At that time GCC was renamed
from the "GNU C Compiler" to the "GNU Compiler Collection".

<p>As a result of those changes the project has a new
<a href="gccmission.html">mission statement</a> which more accurately
reflects the fundamental goals of the project.

<p>We want to work closely with contributors to help and encourage
them to submit their changes for inclusion in GCC.  We thus provide
access to our <a href="#development_sources">development sources</a>
with weekly snapshots and anonymous CVS.  All code continues to be <a
href="contribute.html">assigned to the FSF</a> exactly as before.</p>

<p>We will provide regular, high quality 
<a href="ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/releases/index.html">releases</a>.
We want those releases to work well on a variety of native (including
GNU/Linux) and cross targets and use an extensive <a href="testresults/">test
suite</a> as well as a <a href="benchresults/">benchmark suite</a> to
maintain and improve quality.
<a href="gcc-2.95/gcc-2.95.1.html">GCC 2.95.1</a> is the current release.
