<h1><small>Welcome to the GCC home page!</small></h1>

<p>GCC is the GNU Compiler Collection, which currently contains
front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran,
<a href="java/">Java</a>, and Ada, as well as libraries for these
languages (<a href="libstdc++/">libstdc++</a>, libgcj,...).
<a href="frontends.html">Further frontends</a> are available.</p>

<p>Major decisions about GCC are made by the <a href="steering.html">
steering committee</a>, guided by the <a href="gccmission.html">
mission statement</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage everyone to <a href="contribute.html">contribute changes</a>
and help testing GCC, and we provide access to our development sources with
<a href="cvs.html">anonymous CVS</a> and <a href="snapshots.html">weekly
snapshots</a>.</p>

<p>We strive to provide regular, high quality
<a href="releases.html">releases</a>, which we want to work well on a variety
of native (including GNU/Linux) and cross targets.
To that end, we use an extensive <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/testing/">test
suite and automated regression testers</a> as well
as various <a href="benchmarks/">benchmark suites and automated testers</a>
to maintain and improve quality.</p>

<dt><b>February 25, 2004</b></dt>
<dd>
The <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/tree-ssa/">tree-ssa branch</a>
has been frozen to be incorporated into GCC 3.5.0.  Tree SSA
incorporates two new high-level intermediate languages (GENERIC and
GIMPLE), an optimization framework for GIMPLE based on the Static
Single Assignment (SSA) representation, several SSA-based optimizers
and various other improvements to the internal structure of the
compiler that allow new optimization opportunities that were difficult
to implement before.
</dd>

<dt><b>February 24, 2004</b></dt>
<dd>
<a href="gcc-3.3/">GCC 3.3.3</a> has been released.
</dd>

<dt><b>February 6, 2004</b></dt>
<dd>
Josef Zlomek of SUSE Labs and Daniel Berlin of IBM Research have contributed
Variable Tracking.  It generates more accurate debug info about locations of
variables and allows debugging code compiled
with <code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code>.
</dd>

<dt><b>October 18, 2003</b></dt>
<dd>
Bernardo Innocenti of Develer S.r.l. has contributed the
<a href="http://www.uclinux.org/pub/uClinux/uclinux-elf-tools/gcc-3/">
m68k-uclinux target</a> and improved support for ColdFire cores, based
on former work by Paul Dale (SnapGear, Inc.) and Peter Barada (Motorola, Inc.).
</dd>

<dt><b>October 17, 2003</b></dt>
<dd>
<a href="gcc-3.3/">GCC 3.3.2</a> has been released.
</dd>

<dt><b>August 27, 2003</b></dt>
<dd>
Nicolas Pitre has contributed his hand-coded floating-point support code
for ARM.  It is both significantly smaller and faster than the 
existing C-based implementation.  The arm-elf configuration uses the new 
code now, and other ports will follow.
</dd>

<dt><b>August 8, 2003</b></dt>
<dd>
<a href="gcc-3.3/">GCC 3.3.1</a> has been released.
</dd>

<dt><b>June 26, 2003</b></dt>
<dd>
Ben Elliston of Wasabi Systems, Inc. has converted the existing ARM
processor pipeline description to the new <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Processor-pipeline-description.html">DFA
pipeline description model</a>.
It will be part of the GCC 3.4.0 release.
