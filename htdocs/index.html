Welcome to the egcs project!

<p>egcs is an experimental step in the development of GCC, the GNU C
compiler.  If you are new to the egcs project, you should probably read
the <a href="mission.html">egcs mission statement</a>.

<p>We want to work closely with contributors to help and encourage
them to submit their changes for inclusion in egcs.  The egcs project
provides access to its <a href="#development_sources">development sources</a>
with weekly snapshots and anonymous CVS.  All code continues to be <a
href="contribute.html">assigned to the FSF</a> exactly as before and
is available to the gcc2 maintainers for ultimate inclusion into the
gcc2 tree.

<p>We will provide regular, high quality <a href="#releases">releases</a>.
We want those releases to work well on a variety of native (including
GNU/Linux) and cross targets and use an extensive <a href="testresults/">test
suite</a> as well as a <a href="benchresults/">benchmark suite</a> to
maintain and improve quality.
<a href="egcs-1.1/egcs-1.1.2.html">egcs-1.1.2</a> is the current release.
<a href="gcc-2.95/gcc-2.95.html">gcc-2.95</a> is the next major release.

<p>egcs is pronounced "eggs", the c is silent.

<dt><b>May 22, 1999</b></dt>
<dd>
The Fortran Birds-of-a-Feather session at <a
href="http://www.linuxexpo.org/">LinuxExpo</a> has been successful
in providing us with the information to guide future development of
GNU Fortran.  Notes and conclusions will be posted here shortly.
</dd>

<dt><b>April 23, 1999</b></dt>
<dd>
<code>g77</code> now supports optional run-time checking
of array subscript expressions.
The official name of the compile-time option for this
has not yet been decided,
but it will be in time for 1.2.
</dd>

<dt><b>April 20, 1999</b></dt>
<dd>
Yes, it is not a hoax: The egcs steering committee is appointed official
GNU maintainer for GCC; the egcs team will be responsible for rolling out
future GCC releases.

<br>This will require some changes in policy and procedures for the project.
We will provide more information on those changes as they are available.

<br><a href="http://www.gnu.org">www.gnu.org</a> has the FSF announcement
under the "GNU flashes" heading.

<dt><b>April 15, 1999</b></dt>

Mark Mitchell is now a co-maintainer of the C++ front end along with
Jason Merrill.

We have set up a new <a href="lists.html">mailing list</a>
<a href="http://egcs.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-cvs-wwwdocs/">egcs-cvs-wwwdocs</a>
that tracks checkins to the egcs webpages CVS repository.

<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/">Cygnus</a> announces the first public
release of libgcj, the runtime component of the GNU compiler for Java.

<dt><b>April 6, 1999</b></dt>

A new snapshot of the C++ standard library re-write has been
released. This release includes SGI STL 3.12, a working valarray, and
several (but not all) parts of templatized iostreams--for more information see:
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/libstdc++/"> libstdc++-2.90.4</a>.

<dt><b>March 23, 1999</b></dt>
<dd> 
Through the efforts of John Wehle and Bernd Schmidt, GCC will now attempt to
keep the stack 64bit aligned on the x86 and allocate doubles on 64bit
boundaries.  This can significantly improve floating point performance on the
x86.  Work will continue on aligning the stack and floating point values in
the stack.
