gcc.gnu.org suffered hardware failure and had to be restored from backups.
We do not believe any data was lost in the CVS repository.  We did lose any
pending messages in the mail queue as that does not get backed up.  At this
time, everything should be functional except for htdig.  The mailing list
archives on the web site are also out of date and will be updated soon.
New mail will update the archives correctly, however.  If you find any
other problems, please email
