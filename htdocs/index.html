<h1><small>Welcome to the GCC home page!</small></h1>

<p>GCC is the GNU Compiler Collection, which currently contains
front ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran,
<a href="java/">Java</a>, and Ada, as well as libraries for these
languages (<a href="libstdc++/">libstdc++</a>, libgcj,...).</p>

<p>Major decisions about GCC are made by the <a href="steering.html">
steering committee</a>, guided by the <a href="gccmission.html">
mission statement</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage everyone to <a href="contribute.html">contribute changes</a>
and help testing GCC, and we provide access to our development sources with
<a href="cvs.html">anonymous CVS</a> and <a href="snapshots.html">weekly
snapshots</a>.</p>

<p>We strive to provide regular, high quality
<a href="releases.html">releases</a>, which we want to work well on a variety
of native (including GNU/Linux) and cross targets.
To that end, we use an extensive <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/testing/">test
suite and automated regression testers</a> as well
as various <a href="benchmarks/">benchmark suites and automated testers</a>
to maintain and improve quality.</p>
