Welcome to the egcs project!

<p>egcs is an experimental step in the development of GCC, the GNU C
compiler.  If you are new to the egcs project, you should probably read
the <a href="mission.html">egcs mission statement</a>.

<p>We want to work closely with contributors to help and encourage
them to submit their changes for inclusion in egcs.  The egcs project
provides access to its <a href="#development_sources">development sources</a>
with weekly snapshots and anonymous CVS.  All code continues to be <a
href="contribute.html">assigned to the FSF</a> exactly as before and
is available to the gcc2 maintainers for ultimate inclusion into the
gcc2 tree.

<p>We will provide regular, high quality <a href="#releases">releases</a>.
We want those releases to work well on a variety of native (including
GNU/Linux) and cross targets and use an extensive <a href="testresults/">test
suite</a> as well as a <a href="benchresults/">benchmark suite</a> to
maintain and improve quality.
<a href="egcs-1.1/egcs-1.1.2.html">egcs-1.1.2</a> is the current release.
<a href="gcc-2.95/gcc-2.95.html">gcc-2.95</a> is the next major release.

<p>egcs is pronounced "eggs", the c is silent.

<dt><b>May 27, 1999</b></dt>
<dd>
Toon Moene has emailed (and posted) his notes on
the GNU Fortran (<code>g77</code>) Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) session at <a
href="http://www.linuxexpo.org/">LinuxExpo</a>
to the appropriate lists,
and Craig Burley has made Toon's notes available (in edited form) at <a
href="http://world.std.com/~burley/bof.html">http://world.std.com/~burley/bof.html</a>.

<br>Probably the most important decision reached at the meeting
is that Craig Burley will undertake the long-awaited <q>0.6 rewrite</q>
of the <code>g77</code> front end as his top priority for
the <code>gcc</code> 3.0 release,
rather than focusing on implementing some of the <q>most wanted</q>
features that didn't require the rewrite,
such as Cray pointers.

<br>The BOF provided us with
some additional information to guide future development of
GNU Fortran.
Thanks to all who attended, whether in person or in spirit!

<dt><b>May 18, 1999</b></dt>

The sixth snapshot of the ongoing re-written C++ Standard Library has
been released.  It includes SGI STL 3.2, an automatically generated
<tt>&lt;limits&gt;<\tt>, a partially re-written valarray, a working
stringbuf and stringstream (for basic types). For more informtaion,
please check <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/libstdc++/">
libstdc++-2.90.4</a>. 
</dd>
<dt><b>April 23, 1999</b></dt>
<dd>
<code>g77</code> now supports optional run-time checking
of array subscript expressions
via the <code>-fbounds-check</code> compiler option.
(The same option applies to whatever bounds-checking
applies for other languages, such as Java.
The <code>-ffortran-bounds-check</code> option specifies
bounds-checking for Fortran code.)
</dd>

<dt><b>April 20, 1999</b></dt>
<dd>
Yes, it is not a hoax: The egcs steering committee is appointed official
GNU maintainer for GCC; the egcs team will be responsible for rolling out
future GCC releases.

<br>This will require some changes in policy and procedures for the project.
We will provide more information on those changes as they are available.

<br><a href="http://www.gnu.org">www.gnu.org</a> has the FSF announcement
under the "GNU flashes" heading.
</dd>

<dt><b>April 15, 1999</b></dt>
<dd>
Mark Mitchell is now a co-maintainer of the C++ front end along with
Jason Merrill.

contributors.

<p> Be aware that snapshots and CVS provides direct access to development
sources, which can be unstable at times.  If you are using the development
sources, we recommend you sign up for one or more of the
