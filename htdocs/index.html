<h1><small>Welcome to the GCC home page!</small></h1>

<p>GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection, includes front ends for
C, C++, Objective-C, <a href="fortran/">Fortran</a>,
<a href="java/">Java</a>, and Ada, as well as libraries for these
languages (<a href="libstdc++/">libstdc++</a>, libgcj,...).</p>

<p>We strive to provide regular, high quality
<a href="releases.html">releases</a>, which we want to work well on a variety
of native and cross targets (including GNU/Linux), and encourage everyone 
to <a href="contribute.html">contribute changes</a> and
<a href="testing/">help testing</a> GCC.
Our sources are readily and freely available
via <a href="cvs.html">CVS</a> and <a href="snapshots.html">weekly
snapshots</a>.</p>

<p>Major decisions about GCC are made by the <a href="steering.html">
steering committee</a>, guided by the <a href="gccmission.html">
mission statement</a>.</p>

gcc.gnu.org suffered hardware failure and had to be restored from backups.
We do not believe any data was lost in the CVS repository.  We did lose any
pending messages in the mail queue as that does not get backed up.  At this
time, everything should be functional except for htdig.  The mailing list
archives on the web site are also out of date and will be updated soon.
New mail will update the archives correctly, however.  If you find any
other problems, please email
