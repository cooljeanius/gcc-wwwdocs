<h1>GCC: Anonymous read-only Git access</h1>

<p>Our Git source repository is available read-only to the public at
large.  That way you can pick up any version (including releases) of
GCC that is in our repository.</p>

<p>In addition you
can <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=gcc.git">browse our
Git history online</a>.</p>

<p>(Our <a href="about.html#git">web pages are managed via Git in a
separate repository</a>.)</p>


<h2>Using the Git repository</h2>

<p>Assuming you have
<a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> installed, you can
check out the GCC sources using the following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>git clone git://gcc.gnu.org/git/gcc.git SomeLocalDir</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are behind a firewall that does not allow the git protocol
through, you can replace <code>git://</code> with <code>https://</code>.

<p>If there is another local repository accessible you can avoid
re-downloading everything by using <code>--reference</code>, e.g.</p>

<blockquote><code>git clone --reference original-gcc --dissociate ssh://gcc.gnu.org/git/gcc.git new-gcc</code></blockquote>

<p>But if you own this other copy, you probably want to use
separate <a href="#worktrees">worktrees</a> instead of multiple clones.

<h3 id="generated_files">Generated files</h3>

<p>Our source tree contains a number of files that are generated
from other source files by build tools such as Bison, Autoconf, and
Gperf.  Bison is now required when using Git to access our sources,
but all other generated files are included in the source tree so that
GCC can be built without these build tools. The Git checkout and
update operations do not insure that the timestamps of generated files
are later than those of the files they are generated from.  The script
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code> updates the timestamps for all these
generated files.  See the comments in that script for instructions on
running it.</p>

<p>GCC's build system (in particular Make) uses file timestamps to
determine if a generated file needs to be updated by running a particular
build tool.  Because of this, GCC's build system may believe that
a generated file needs regenerating even though its source has not
changed, and require a particular build tool to rebuild that generated
file.  If the appropriate build tool is installed on your system, then
this will not be a problem.  If you do not intend to make changes to
the source, you can avoid installing these build tools by running
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code>.</p>

<p>There has been some discussion of removing these generated files
from GCC's Git source tree (there is no discussion of removing them
from the released source tarballs).  If that happens then
building GCC from the Git source tree would require installing
the above mentioned build tools.  Installing these build tools is not
particularly difficult, but can be time consuming especially if you
only occasionally install GCC on a particular system.</p>

<p>The build tools that GCC uses are all available from the GNU
Project (see <a href="https://www.gnu.org">https://www.gnu.org</a>),
are often already available on many systems, and can often be found
already built for some systems.  A partial list of these build tools
is: Autoconf, Bison, Xgettext, Automake, and Gperf.</p>

<h3>Conflicts when using <code>git pull</code></h3>

<p>It is not uncommon to get Git conflict messages for some generated files
when updating your local sources from the Git repository.  Typically such
conflicts occur with autoconf generated files.  Such an error is of
the form:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by merge:
        gcc/configure
Please commit your changes or stash them before you merge.
Aborting
</pre></blockquote>

<p>As long as you haven't been making modifications to the generated files
or the generator files, it is safe to revert the local differences
using <code>git checkout</code> on the affected files, then run
<code>git pull</code> again.</p>

<p>If you have changes you want to keep that result in such an error,
there are a few options.  You can keep those changes on a local branch
rather than on a branch tracking upstream sources.  If you wish to
keep those changes uncommitted, do <code>git stash</code>
before <code>git pull</code> and <code>git stash pop</code>
after <code>git pull</code>.  If you commit them directly to your
local upstream-tracking branch, you may prefer to use <code>git pull
--rebase</code> instead of plain <code>git pull</code>.</p>


<h2 id="tags">Branches and Tags</h2>

<p>A branch called <em>branchname</em> can be checked out with the
following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>git checkout <em>branchname</em></code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>(The release branch of the GCC <em>SERIES</em> release series
is named <code>releases/gcc-<em>SERIES</em></code>.)</p>

<p>Similarly a tag called <em>tagname</em> can be checked out with the
following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>git checkout <em>tagname</em></code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>(The Git tag for GCC <i>X</i>.<i>Y</i>.<i>Z</i> is of the form
<code>releases/gcc-<em>X</em>.<em>Y</em>.<em>Z</em></code>.  Under the
release numbering scheme used for GCC 5 and later release
series, <em>Y</em> is always nonzero and <em>Z</em> is always zero for
a release, with other version numbers being used for development
versions.)</p>

<p>The following are some representative examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>releases/gcc-10 (a branch)</li>
  <li>releases/gcc-9 (a branch)</li>
  <li>releases/gcc-9.3.0 (a tag)</li>
  <li>releases/gcc-4.9 (a branch)</li>
  <li>releases/gcc-4.9.0 (a tag)</li>
</ul>

<p>To get a list of available branches, after checking out any branch,
use the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>git branch -a</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, to list tags:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>git tag -l</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To view logs for a branch only up to the point at which it was
created, use the command <code>git log origin/<em>branchname</em>
^origin/<em>parentbranchname</em></code>; for example:

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>git log origin/releases/gcc-9 ^origin/master</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="worktrees">Worktrees</h3>

<p>Git allows you to share the git object repository between multiple working
directories, each tracking a different branch.  For instance, to create a
worktree for a release branch, do</p>

<blockquote><pre>
git worktree add ../gcc-9 releases/gcc-9
</pre></blockquote>

To create a worktree for a new project branch based on master, do

<blockquote><pre>
git worktree add -b <em>project</em> ../project master
</pre></blockquote>

<h3 id="repolayout">Repository Layout</h3>

<p>By default, a <code>git clone</code> operation will only fetch the
main development, release branches and their associated tags from the
server.  This will be sufficient for most users, but a number of
additional branches can also be fetched if necessary.</p>

<p>The following areas exist on the server:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>refs/heads/master</i> - The active development version of the
    compiler.</li>
  <li><i>refs/heads/releases/*</i> - Release branches.</li>
  <li><i>refs/heads/devel/*</i> - topic-specific development branches
    - see <a href="#devbranches">Active Development Branches</a>.
    Branches and tags in this space may be moved to refs/dead once active
    development is completed or abandoned.</li>
  <li><i>refs/tags/*</i> - tags for all of the above branches.</li>
  <li><i>refs/vendors/*/{heads,tags}/*</i> - vendor-specific branches and
    tags.  These are owned and maintained by the respective
    vendor, but made available publicly.  Non-fast-forward pushes
    are permitted on these branches.</li>
  <li><i>refs/users/*/{heads,tags}/*</i> - personal developer branches and
    tags.  These are owned and maintained by the individual developer.
    Non-fast-forward pushes are permitted on these branches.</li>
  <li><i>refs/dead/heads/*</i> - completed or abandoned development
    branches.</li>
  <li><i>refs/meta/config</i> - local configuration data for the
    commit hooks on the server.</li>
  <li><i>refs/deleted/*/{heads,tags}/*</i> - old branches and tags
    from the SVN repository that were deleted before the conversion to
    git.</li>
  <li><i>refs/git-svn-old/*</i> - various branches and tags from the
    git-svn pre-conversion git mirror.</li>
  <li><i>refs/git-old/*</i> - various branches and tags from the
    git-svn pre-conversion git mirror that were local to that git
    repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can download any of the additional branches by adding a suitable
fetch specification to your local copy of the git repostiory.  For
example, if your remote is called 'origin' (the default with git
clone) you can add the 'dead' development branches by running:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
    git config --add remote.origin.fetch "+refs/dead/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/dead/*"
    git config --add remote.origin.fetch "+refs/dead/tags/*:refs/tags/dead/*"
    git fetch origin
</pre></blockquote>

<p>which will place the dead branches in <code>remotes/origin/dead</code>
  and the tags in <code>tags/dead</code>.</p>

<p>You can use <code>git ls-remote</code> to get a complete list of
refs that the server holds.</p>

  the goal is to chose an alternative per instruction, usable as a base
  during register allocation, which ideally is not changed during reload
  if registers could be allocated.  This will not be possible in all cases,
  especially when addresses generated during spilling will be invalid on
  the target machine.  But we should be able to do away with fake register
  classes representing strict unions of other register classes.  The
