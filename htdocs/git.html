<h1>GCC: Anonymous read-only Git access</h1>

<p><strong>The conversion from SVN to Git is in progress.  The
repository described here may not yet be the final version of that
conversion.</strong></p>

<p>Our Git source repository is available read-only to the public at
large.  That way you can pick up any version (including releases) of
GCC that is in our repository.</p>

<p>In addition you
can <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=gcc.git">browse our
Git history online</a>.</p>

<p>(Our <a href="about.html#git">web pages are managed via Git in a
separate repository</a>.)</p>


<h2>Using the Git repository</h2>

<p>Assuming you have
<a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> installed, you can
check out the GCC sources using the following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>git clone git://gcc.gnu.org/git/gcc.git SomeLocalDir</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are behind a firewall that does not allow the git protocol
through, you can replace <code>git://</code> with <code>https://</code>.

<p>When doing multiple clones to several local repositories you can avoid
re-downloading everything by using <code>--reference</code>, e.g.

<blockquote><code>git clone --reference original-gcc ssh://gcc.gnu.org/git.gcc.git new-gcc</code></blockquote>

This will also save disk space. Git will do this automatically when cloning
from a local repository on the same file system. It is also possible to do a
shallow checkout with <code>--depth</code> to limit history, but that might
limit your ability to work with existing branches.

(Only use the https protocol if the git protocol does not work; https has
a higher server overhead and will be slower.)</p>

<h3 id="generated_files">Generated files</h3>

<p>Our source tree contains a number of files that are generated
from other source files by build tools such as Bison, Autoconf, and
Gperf.  Bison is now required when using Git to access our sources,
but all other generated files are included in the source tree so that
GCC can be built without these build tools. The Git checkout and
update operations do not insure that the timestamps of generated files
are later than those of the files they are generated from.  The script
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code> updates the timestamps for all these
generated files.  See the comments in that script for instructions on
running it.</p>

<p>GCC's build system (in particular Make) uses file timestamps to
determine if a generated file needs to be updated by running a particular
build tool.  Because of this, GCC's build system may believe that
a generated file needs regenerating even though its source has not
changed, and require a particular build tool to rebuild that generated
file.  If the appropriate build tool is installed on your system, then
this will not be a problem.  If you do not intend to make changes to
the source, you can avoid installing these build tools by running
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code>.</p>

<p>There has been some discussion of removing these generated files
from GCC's Git source tree (there is no discussion of removing them
from the released source tarballs).  If that happens then
building GCC from the Git source tree would require installing
the above mentioned build tools.  Installing these build tools is not
particularly difficult, but can be time consuming especially if you
only occasionally install GCC on a particular system.</p>

<p>The build tools that GCC uses are all available from the GNU
Project (see <a href="https://www.gnu.org">https://www.gnu.org</a>),
are often already available on many systems, and can often be found
already built for some systems.  A partial list of these build tools
is: Autoconf, Bison, Xgettext, Automake, and Gperf.</p>

<h3>Conflicts when using <code>git pull</code></h3>

<p>It is not uncommon to get Git conflict messages for some generated files
when updating your local sources from the Git repository.  Typically such
conflicts occur with autoconf generated files.</p>

<p>As long as you haven't been making modifications to the generated files
or the generator files, it is safe to revert the local differences
using <code>git checkout</code> on the affected files, then run
<code>git pull</code> again.</p>


<h2 id="tags">Branches and Tags</h2>

<p>A branch called <em>branchname</em> can be checked out with the
following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>git clone -b <em>branchname</em> git://gcc.gnu.org/git/gcc.git gcc</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>(The release branch of the GCC <em>SERIES</em> release series
is named <code>releases/gcc-<em>SERIES</em></code>.)</p>

<p>Similarly a tag called <em>tagname</em> can be checked out with the
following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>git clone -b <em>tagname</em> git://gcc.gnu.org/git/gcc.git gcc</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>(The Git tag for GCC <i>X</i>.<i>Y</i>.<i>Z</i> is of the form
<code>releases/gcc-<em>X</em>.<em>Y</em>.<em>Z</em></code>.  Under the
release numbering scheme used for GCC 5 and later release
series, <em>Y</em> is always nonzero and <em>Z</em> is always zero for
a release, with other version numbers being used for development
versions.)</p>

<p>The following list provides some representative examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>releases/gcc-9 (a branch)</li>
  <li>releases/gcc-8 (a branch)</li>
  <li>releases/gcc-7.5.0 (a tag)</li>
  <li>releases/gcc-4.9 (a branch)</li>
  <li>releases/gcc-4.9.0 (a tag)</li>
</ul>

<p>To get a list of available branches, after checking out any branch,
use the command:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>git branch -a</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, to list tags:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>git tag -l</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To view logs for a branch only up to the point at which it was
created, use the command <code>git log origin/<em>branchname</em>
^origin/<em>parentbranchname</em></code>; for example:

<blockquote>
<p>
<code>git log origin/releases/gcc-9 ^origin/master</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
