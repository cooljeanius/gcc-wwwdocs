<h1>Porting to GCC 4.7</h1>

<p>
The GCC 4.7 release series differs from previous GCC releases in more
than the usual list of
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.7/changes.html">changes</a>. Some of
these are a result of bug fixing, and some old behaviors have been
intentionally changed in order to support new standards, or relaxed
in standards-conforming ways to facilitate compilation or runtime
performance.  Some of these changes are not visible to the naked eye
and will not cause problems when updating from older versions.
</p>

<p>
However, some of these changes are visible, and can cause grief to
users porting to GCC 4.7. This document is an effort to identify major
issues and provide clear solutions in a quick and easily searched
manner. Additions and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
</p>

<h2>General issues</h2>

<h3>Use of invalid flags when linking</h3>

<p>
Earlier releases did not warn or error about completely invalid
options on gcc/g++/gfortran etc. command lines, if nothing was
compiled, but only linking was performed. This is no longer the
case. For example,
</p>

<pre>
gcc -Wl -o foo foo.o -mflat_namespace
</pre>

<p>
Now produces the following error
</p>

<pre>
error: unrecognized command line option &lsquo;-Wl&rsquo;
error: unrecognized command line option &lsquo;-mflat_namespace&rsquo;
</pre>

<p>
Invalid options need to be removed from the command line or replaced
by something that is valid.
</p>

<h2>C language issues</h2>

<h3>Boolean type promotion changes</h3>

<p>
The C compiler no longer promotes boolean values in arithmetic
statements to integer values. Configure-related code that checks for
C99's &lt;stdbool.h&gt; may be impacted. If the following line is
newly present in configure logs, then &lt;stdbool.h&gt; support is
incorrectly configured.
</p>

<pre>
checking for stdbool.h that conforms to C99... no
</pre>


<h2>C++ language issues</h2>

<h3>Header dependency changes</h3>

<p>
Many of the standard C++ library include files have been edited to no
longer include &lt;unistd.h&gt; to remove <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/PR49745">namespace pollution</a>.
</p>

<p>
As such, C++ programs that used functions
including <code>truncate</code>, <code>sleep</code>
or <code>pipe</code> without first including &lt;unistd.h&gt; will no
longer compile. The diagnostic produced is similar to:
</p>

<pre>
error: &lsquo;truncate&rsquo; was not declared in this scope
</pre>

<pre>
error: &lsquo;sleep&rsquo; was not declared in this scope
</pre>

<pre>
error: &lsquo;pipe&rsquo; was not declared in this scope
</pre>

<pre>
error: there are no arguments to 'offsetof' that depend on a template
parameter, so a declaration of 'offsetof' must be available
</pre>

<p>
Fixing this issue is easy: just include &lt;unistd.h&gt;.
</p>

<h3>Note on proper checking for thread support</h3>

<p>
At no time, should user-level code use private
GCC-implementation-space macros such as
<code>_GLIBCXX_HAS_GTHREADS</code> to determine at compile-time
concurrency support. Instead, use the POSIX
macro <code>_REENTRANT</code>.
</p>

<h3>Name lookup changes</h3>

<p>
The C++ compiler no longer performs an extra unqualified lookups that
had performed in the past, namely <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/PR24163">dependant base class scope lookups</a> and
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/PR29131">unqualified template function</a>
lookups.
</p>

<p>
C++ programs that depended on the compiler's previous behavior may
longer compile. For example, code such as
</p>

<pre>
template&lt;typename T&gt;
int t(T i)
{ return f(i); }

int
f(int i)
{ return i; }

int
main()
{
  return t(1);
}
</pre>


<p>
Will result in the following diagnostic:
</p>
<pre>
In instantiation of &lsquo;int t(T) [with T = int]&rsquo;
  required from here
  error: &lsquo;f&rsquo; was not declared in this scope, and no declarations were found by argument-dependent lookup at the point of instantiation [-fpermissive]
  note: &lsquo;int f(int)&rsquo; declared here, later in the translation unit
</pre>

<p>
To fix, make sure the function <code>f</code> in the code above is
declared before first use in function <code>t</code>. Like so:
</p>

<pre>
int
f(int i)
{ return i; }

template&lt;typename T&gt;
int t(T i)
{ return f(i); }

int
main()
{
  return t(1);
}
</pre>

<p>
This can be temporarily worked around by using <code>-fpermissive</code>.
</p>

<h3>Detection of redeclared variable names in nested scopes</h3>

<p>
The C++ compiler no longer allows identical identifiers in some <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/PR2288">nested scopes</a>. Namely:
</p>

<pre>
void f(int);

int main()
{
    for (int i=0;;++i)
    {
      int i=5;
      f(i);
    }
    return 0;
 }
</pre>

<p>
Now results in the error:
<p>

<pre>
error: redeclaration of &lsquo;int i&rsquo;
error: &lsquo;int i&rsquo; previously declared here
</pre>

<p>
To fix this, rename the inner variable from <code>i</code> to a
distinct identifier.
</p>

<h3>User-defined literals and whitespace</h3>

<p>
The C++ compiler in ISO C11 mode <code>std={c++11,c++0x,gnu++11,gnu++0x}</code>
supports user defined literals, which are incompatible with some valid
ISO C++03 code.
</p>

<p>
In particular, whitespace is now needed after a string literal and
before something that could be a valid user defined literal. Take the
valid ISO C++03 code
</p>

<pre>
const char *p = &ldquo;foobar&rdquo;__TIME__;
</pre>

<p>In C++03, the <code>__TIME__</code> macro expands to some string
literal and is concatenated with the other one.  In
C++11 <code>__TIME__</code> isn't expanded, instead operator
"" <code>__TIME__</code> is being looked up, resulting in the
following diagnostic:
</p>

<pre>
 error: unable to find string literal operator &lsquo;operator&ldquo;&rdquo; __TIME__&rsquo;
</pre>

<p>
This applies to any string literal followed without whitespace by some
macro.  To fix, just add some whitespace between the string literal
and the macro name.
</p>
