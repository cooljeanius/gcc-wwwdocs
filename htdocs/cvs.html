<p>In an ongoing effort to accelerate development of egcs and provide an
open development environment, we are making the egcs CVS source repository
available readonly to the public at large.

<p>You'll be able to pick up the latest code whenever you want instead of
waiting for periodic snapshots.  You'll even be able to check out the
release branch(es) since they also live in the CVS repository.

<p>If you would like to browse the CVS history online via your web
browser it is available via <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb">cvsweb</a>.

<p>If you don't already have CVS, we recommend you pick up a recent copy from
cyclic software <a href="http://www.cyclic.com"> at http://www.cyclic.com</a>.

<p>Assuming you have CVS installed on your machine you can check out the egcs
sources with the following sequence of commands:

<p>set CVSROOT in your environment to

<p>:pserver:anoncvs@egcs.cygnus.com:/egcs/carton/cvsfiles 

<p>Or alternately add "-d :pserver:anoncvs@egcs.cygnus.com:/egcs/carton/cvsfiles"
in the CVS commands below (place it immediately after "cvs" -- ie
before any other cvs arguments).

<p>Issue the command "cvs login".  You will be prompted for a password;
reply with "anoncvs".

<p>Issue the command "cvs -z 9 co egcs" to check out the egcs sources.

<p>Once you've got the repository checked out "cvs update" will sync your
local copy with those in the repository.  See the CVS manual for additional
information on how to use CVS.



<p> If you want to check out any specific snapshot use the
command:
<pre>
cvs -z 9 co -regcs_ss_yymmdd
</pre>

<p>If you already have a tree checked out and you want to make it
look like snapshot yymmdd you'd do:
<pre>
cvs -z 9 update -regcs_ss_yymmdd
</pre>


<p>Enjoy!

<p>Also note that you may wish to review the CVS manual which is provided
in texinfo form in the CVS sources.
