<h1>GCC: Anonymous read-only CVS access</h1>

<p>In an ongoing effort to accelerate development of GCC and provide an
open development environment, we are making our CVS source repository
available read-only to the public at large.</p>

<p>That way you can pick up any version (including releases) of GCC that
is in our repository or our <a href="#wwwdocs">web pages</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, you can browse our CVS history online at</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/gcc/">savannah.gnu.org</a>
      using viewcvs, or</li>
  <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/">gcc.gnu.org</a>
      using cvsweb.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Using the CVS repository</h2>

<p><b>In January 2004, these instructions were modified to reflect security
changes implemented after an attack on the Free Software Foundation's
site.</b></p>

<p>Assuming you have both <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a>
and SSH installed, you can check out the GCC sources as follows:</p>

<ol type="i">
 <li>Set CVS_RSH in your environment to <code>ssh</code>.</li>
 <li>Set CVSROOT in your environment to 
     <code>:ext:anoncvs@savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gcc</code>.&nbsp;
     Alternately add 
     <code>-d :ext:anoncvs@savannah.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gcc</code>
     immediately after <code>cvs</code> in the commands below.</li>
 <li>The command <code>cvs -qz9 checkout -P gcc wwwdocs</code>, 
     will check out both modules in our CVS repository.&nbsp;
     Module <code>gcc</code> is the compiler source while module
     <code>wwwdocs</code> contains the sources for our web pages.</li>
</ol>

<p>In case of problems with the repository at savannah.gnu.org please
contact savannah-hackers@gnu.org.</p>


<h3><a name="generated_files"></a>Generated files</h3>

<p>Our CVS source tree contains a number of files that are generated
from other source files by build tools such as Bison, Autoconf, and
Gperf.  Bison is now required when using CVS to access our sources,
but all other generated files are included in the source tree so that
GCC can be built without these build tools. The CVS checkout and
update operations do not insure that the timestamps of generated files
are later than those of the files they are generated from.  The script
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code> updates the timestamps for all these
generated files.  See the comments in that script for instructions on
running it.</p>

<p>GCC's build system (in particular Make) uses file timestamps to
determine if a generated file needs to be updated by running a particular
build tool.  Because of this, GCC's build system may believe that
a generated file needs regenerating even though its source has not
changed, and require a particular build tool to rebuild that generated
file.  If the appropriate build tool is installed on your system, then
this will not be a problem.  If you do not intend to make changes to
the source, you can avoid installing these build tools by running
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code>.</p>

<p>There has been some discussion of removing these generated files
from GCC's CVS source tree (there is no discussion of removing them
from the released source tarballs).  If that happens then
building GCC from the CVS source tree would require installing
the above mentioned build tools.  Installing these build tools is not
particularly difficult, but can be time consuming especially if you
only occasionally install GCC on a particular system.</p>

<p>The build tools that GCC uses are all available from the GNU
Project (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a>),
are often already available on many  systems, and can often be found
already built for some systems.  A partial list of these build tools
is: Autoconf, Bison, Xgettext, Automake, and Gperf.</p>

<h3>Conflicts when using <code>cvs update</code></h3>

<p>It is not uncommon to get CVS conflict messages for some generated files
when updating your local sources from the CVS repository.  Typically such
conflicts occur with autoconf generated files.</p>

<p>As long as you haven't been making modifications to the generated files
or the generator files, it is safe to delete the offending file, then run
<code>cvs update</code> again to get a new copy.</p>


<h2>CVS tags, branches and checkouts</h2>

<p> You can check out the latest version of the GCC <em>x</em>.<em>y</em>
release branch with the following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>cvs -z 9 co -P -rgcc-<em>x</em>_<em>y</em>-branch gcc</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>By changing the <code>-r</code> argument above you can check out
particular releases or snapshots or the latest snapshot.  </p>

  <code>[cs]</code> in the subject line.</dd>

  <dt>csl-arm-branch</dt>
  <dd>CodeSourcery branch for developing ARM back end improvements.
  The branch is maintained by CodeSourcery personnel.  Patches should
  be marked with the tag <code>[csl-arm-branch]</code> in the subject
  line.</dd>

  <dt>csl-hpux-branch</dt>
  <dd>CodeSourcery branch for developing HP-UX improvements.
  The branch is maintained by CodeSourcery personnel.  Patches should
  be marked with the tag <code>[csl-hpux-branch]</code> in the subject
  line.</dd>

  <dt>hammer-3_3-branch</dt>
  <dd>The goal of this branch is to have a stable
  compiler based on GCC 3.3 with improved performance for AMD's
  64-bit Hammer CPUs.  The branch is maintained by Jan Hubicka &lt;<a
  href="mailto:jh@suse.cz">jh@suse.cz</a>&gt; and Andreas Jaeger
  &lt;<a href="mailto:aj@suse.de">aj@suse.de</a>&gt;.  Patches added
  on this branch might not be appropriate for the GCC 3.3 branch due
  to our policies concerning release branches.  All patches will be
  added to mainline CVS (for 3.4).  The branch is regularly merged
  with the GCC 3.3 branch.</dd>

  <dt>libobjc-branch</dt>
  <dd>The branch is aimed to clean up libobjc and make it run
  on Darwin.  Patches should be marked with the tag <code>
  [libobjc-branch]</code> in the subject line. Patches can
  be approved by <a href="mailto:pinskia@gcc.gnu.org">Andrew 
  Pinski</a> or <a href="mailto:n.pero@mi.flashnet.it">
  Nicola Pero</a>.</dd>

  is done in this branch.</dd>

  <dt>tree-profiling-branch</dt>
  <dd>A sub-branch of tree-ssa for the development of profiling heuristics
  and profile based optimizations for trees, such as profile driven inline
  heuristics.  Another goal of this branch is to demonstrate that maintaining
  the CFG and profile information over expanding from GIMPLE trees to RTL
  is feasible and can bring considerable performance improvements.  This
  branch shall contain only patches not acceptable for tree-ssa because of
  the pre-merge freeze.</dd>

  <dd>A sub-branch of tree-ssa that aims at implementing a loop
  nest optimizer at the tree level.</dd>

  <dt>new-regalloc-branch</dt>
  <dd>Daniel Berlin and Michael Matz are working on an implementation of a 
  graph-coloring register allocator on this branch. It is known to bootstrap 
  under x86-linux and ppc-linux.</dd>

  <dt><a href="projects/cfg.html">rtlopt-branch</a></dt>
  <dd>This branch is the successor to the cfg-branch, with the
  exception that it is based on GCC pre-3.4.  The purpose of the branch
  is to develop and test infrastructure for CFG based code improving
  transformations on RTL.</dd>

  <dt>objc-improvements-branch</dt>
  <dd>This branch was originally used to merge Objective-C bug fixes and
  enhancements from Apple Computer into the FSF tree; this has now been
  completed.  Presently, the purpose of the branch is to implement the
  Objective-C++ language in the FSF GCC source tree. The message thread
  starting <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2003-07/msg00535.html">
  here</a> describes this at more length.  This branch is being maintained
  by <a href="mailto:zlaski@apple.com"> Zem Laski &lt;zlaski@apple.com&gt;

<h2><a name="wwwdocs">Web pages</a></h2>

<p>The web pages for the GCC project are also in the CVS repository
and you can check them out, submit patches, etc just like you do for
the compiler itself.  Use <code>cvs co -P wwwdocs</code> to check out
the web pages.</p>

<h2><a name="system">The host system</a></h2>

<p>The setup of the machine running the gcc.gnu.org site is also
available, through
