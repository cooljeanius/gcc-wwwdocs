<h1>GCC: Anonymous read-only CVS access</h1>

<p>In an ongoing effort to accelerate development of GCC and provide an
open development environment, we are making our CVS source repository
available read-only to the public at large.</p>

<p>That way you can pick up any version (including releases) of GCC that
is in our repository or our <a href="#wwwdocs">web pages</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, you can browse our CVS history online at</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://subversions.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/gcc/">subversions.gnu.org</a>
      using viewcvs, or</li>
  <li><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/">gcc.gnu.org</a>
      using cvsweb.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Using the CVS repository</h2>

<p>Assuming you have <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">CVS</a> installed on
your machine you can check out the GCC sources with the following sequence
of commands:</p>

<p>Set CVSROOT in your environment to
<code>:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gcc</code>.
Alternately add
<code>-d :pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/gcc</code>
in the CVS commands below (place it immediately after <code>cvs</code>,
before any other arguments).</p>

<p>Issue the command <code>cvs login</code>.  You will be prompted for
a password; reply with the empty string.</p>

<p>Issue the command </p>
<blockquote><p><code>cvs -z 9 co gcc</code></p></blockquote>
to check out the compiler sources, respectively
<blockquote><p><code>cvs -z 9 co wwwdocs</code></p></blockquote>
<p>to check out our web pages.</p>

<p>Once you've got the repository checked out, <code>cvs update</code>
will sync your local copy with the repository.  See the CVS manual for
additional information on how to use CVS.</p>

<p>In case of problems with the repository at subversions.gnu.org please
contact savannah-hackers@gnu.org.</p>

<h3><a name="generated_files"></a>Generated files</h3>

<p>Our CVS source tree contains a number of files that are generated
from other source files by build tools such as Bison, Autoconf, and
Gperf.  Bison is now required when using CVS to access our sources,
but all other generated files are included in the source tree so that
GCC can be built without these build tools. The CVS checkout and
update operations do not insure that the timestamps of generated files
are later than those of the files they are generated from.  The script
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code> updates the timestamps for all these
generated files.  See the comments in that script for instructions on
running it.</p>

<p>GCC's build system (in particular Make) uses file timestamps to
determine if a generated file needs to be updated by running a particular
build tool.  Because of this, GCC's build system may believe that
a generated file needs regenerating even though its source has not
changed, and require a particular build tool to rebuild that generated
file.  If the appropriate build tool is installed on your system, then
this will not be a problem.  If you do not intend to make changes to
the source, you can avoid installing these build tools by running
<code>contrib/gcc_update</code>.</p>

<p>There has been some discussion of removing these generated files
from GCC's CVS source tree (there is no discussion of removing them
from the released source tarballs).  If that happens then
building GCC from the CVS source tree would require installing
the above mentioned build tools.  Installing these build tools is not
particularly difficult, but can be time consuming especially if you
only occasionally install GCC on a particular system.</p>

<p>The build tools that GCC uses are all available from the GNU
Project (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org">http://www.gnu.org</a>),
are often already available on many  systems, and can often be found
already built for some systems.  A partial list of these build tools
is: Autoconf, Bison, Xgettext, Automake, and Gperf.</p>

<h3>Conflicts when using <code>cvs update</code></h3>

<p>It is not uncommon to get CVS conflict messages for some generated files
when updating your local sources from the CVS repository.  Typically such
conflicts occur with autoconf generated files.</p>

<p>As long as you haven't been making modifications to the generated files
or the generator files, it is safe to delete the offending file, then run
<code>cvs update</code> again to get a new copy.</p>


<h2>CVS tags, branches and checkouts</h2>

<p> You can check out the latest version of the GCC <em>x</em>.<em>y</em>
release branch with the following command:</p>

<blockquote><p>
<code>cvs -z 9 co -rgcc-<em>x</em>_<em>y</em>-branch gcc</code>
</p></blockquote>

<p>By changing the <code>-r</code> argument above you can check out
particular releases or snapshots or the latest snapshot.  </p>

<h2><a name="wwwdocs">Web pages</a></h2>

<p>The web pages for the GCC project are also in the CVS repository
and you can check them out, submit patches, etc just like you do for
the compiler itself.  Use <code>cvs co wwwdocs</code> to check out
the web pages.</p>

<h2><a name="system">The host system</a></h2>

<p>The setup of the machine running the gcc.gnu.org site is also
available, through
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/?cvsroot=sourceware">
cvsweb</a> and anonymous read-only CVS.  Use the same procedure
as above, but use
<code>:pserver:anoncvs@gcc.gnu.org:/cvs/sourceware</code> for the repository
