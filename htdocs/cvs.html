<h1>GCC: CVS access to the GCC web pages</h1>

<p>Note: the GCC sources are maintained in <a href="svn.html">our SVN
repository</a> now.</p>

<a name="wwwdocs" />
<p>Our web pages and related scripts are available to the public at large
via our CVS source repository.</p>

<p>In addition, you can browse the CVS history <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/wwwdocs/">gcc.gnu.org</a>
using cvsweb.</p>


<h2>Using the CVS repository</h2>

<p>Assuming you have both CVS 
and SSH installed, you can check out the GCC sources as follows:</p>

<ol type="i">
 <li>Set CVS_RSH in your environment to <code>ssh</code>.</li>
 <li>Set CVSROOT in your environment to 
     <code>:pserver:cvs@gcc.gnu.org:/cvs/gcc</code>.&nbsp;
     Alternately add 
     <code>-d :pserver:cvs@gcc.gnu.org:/cvs/gcc</code>
     immediately after <code>cvs</code> in the commands below.</li>
 <li>The command <code>cvs -qz9 checkout -P wwwdocs</code>, 
     will check out the web.</li>
</ol>

<p>Patches should be marked with the tag [wwwdocs] in the subject line.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="write">Read-write CVS access</a></h2>

<p>Check out the GCC sources by setting
<code>CVS_RSH</code> in your environment to "<code>ssh</code>" and issuing
the command</p>

<blockquote><p><code>
cvs -z 9 -d :ext:<i>username</i>@gcc.gnu.org:/cvs/gcc co wwwdocs
</code></p></blockquote>

<p>where <i>username</i> is your user name at gcc.gnu.org.</p>

<h2><a name="checkin">Checking in a change</a></h2>

<p>When you check in changes to our web pages, they will
automatically be checked out into the web server's data area.</p>

<p>The following is meant to provide a very quick overview of how to
check in a change.  It is not meant to be a replacement for the CVS
manual.</p>

<p>In all the commands listed below, you can give an explicit list of
filenames to the cvs command.  We recommend you list files explicitly
when performing checkins to avoid accidental checkins and prefer that
each CVS checkin be of a complete, single logical change, which may
affect multiple files.</p>

<ol>
<li>Sync your sources with the master repository via "<code>cvs
update</code>" before attempting a checkin; this will save you a little
time if someone else has modified that file since the last time you
synced your sources.  It will also identify any files in your local
tree that you have modified.</li>

<li>We recommend using "<code>cvs diff</code>" after applying a patch to a
local tree.  Review the output to make sure that only the changes you
wanted to check in will be checked in.</li>

<li>Use "<code>cvs commit</code>" to check in the patch.  You can enter
the log message via the "<code>-m</code>" argument to commit, or wait for
the editor window to appear and enter the log message in the editor
window.</li>

<li>After exiting the editor, CVS will connect to the GCC cvs server
and check in your changes.  When your prompt returns the checkin is
finished.  A message will be sent to the gcc-cvs-wwwdocs mailing
list indicating that a change was made.  CVS will provide a message if
an error occurs and it will not check in any files.</li>
</ol>

<hr />
<h2><a name="system">The host system</a></h2>

<p>The setup of the machine running the gcc.gnu.org site is also
available, through
<a href="http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/?cvsroot=sourceware">
cvsweb</a> and anonymous read-only CVS.  Use the same procedure
as above, but use
<code>:pserver:anoncvs@gcc.gnu.org:/cvs/sourceware</code> for the
repository and <code>infra</code> for the module.</p>
