<h1>Anonymous read-only CVS access</h1>

<p>In an ongoing effort to accelerate development of egcs and provide an
open development environment, we are making the egcs CVS source repository
available readonly to the public at large.

<p>You'll be able to pick up the latest code whenever you want instead of
waiting for periodic snapshots.  You'll even be able to check out the
release branch(es) since they also live in the CVS repository.

<p>Also note that you may wish to review the CVS manual which is provided
in texinfo form in the CVS sources.

<ul>
  <li><a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/egcs/">Browse the CVS
  history online</a> via your web browser.

  <li><a href="http://www.cyclic.com/">Visit Cyclic Software</a> to pick up a
  recent copy of CVS.  Links to books on the subject can also be found
  there.

  <li>A link to a reasonably simple introduction to CVS can be found
  at <a href="http://www.cyclic.com/cvs/doc-blandy.html">Cyclic</a>,
  which is also available in an <a
  href="http://www.loria.fr/~molli/cvs/doc/cvs_toc.html">HTML
  version</a>

</ul>


<h2>Using the CVS repository</h2>
<p>Assuming you have CVS installed on your machine you can check out the egcs
sources with the following sequence of commands:

<p>Set CVSROOT in your environment to

<pre>	:pserver:anoncvs@egcs.cygnus.com:/cvs/egcs</pre> 

<p>Or alternately add 
<pre>	-d :pserver:anoncvs@egcs.cygnus.com:/cvs/egcs</pre>
in the CVS commands below (place it immediately after <code>"cvs"</code> -- ie
before any other CVS arguments).

Issue the command <code>"cvs login"</code>.  You will be prompted for
a password; reply with <code>"anoncvs"</code>.

<p>Issue the command 
<pre>	cvs -z 9 co egcs</pre> 
to check out the egcs sources.

<p>Once you've got the repository checked out <code>"cvs
update"</code> will sync your local copy with the repository.  See the
CVS manual for additional information on how to use CVS.

<strong>Note</strong>
<p>It may be necessary to obtain patches for common utilities when building
from CVS.  We recommend you read the <a href="faq.html#generated_files"> 
FAQ entry regarding additional tools</a> you may need.  Another 
FAQ entry documents <a href="faq.html#gperf">changes you will likely have
to make to the gperf utility</a>.

<h3>CVS tags and checkouts</h3>

<p> You can check out the latest version of the egcs-1.1.x release
branch with the following command:

<pre>	cvs -z 9 co -regcs_1_1_branch egcs</pre>

<p>By changing the <code>"-r"</code> argument above you can check out
particular releases or snapshots or the latest snapshot.

<ul>
  <li> egcs_1_1_2_release
  <li> egcs_1_1_1_release
  <li> egcs_1_1_release
  <li> egcs_ss_yymmdd
  <li> egcs_latest_snapshot
</ul>


<H2>egcs project web pages</h2>

<p>The web pages for the egcs project are also in the CVS repository
and you can check them out, submit patches, etc just like you do for
the compiler itself.  Use <code>"cvs co wwwdocs"</code> to check out
the web pages.

<p>Enjoy!
