gcc.gnu.org suffered hardware failure and had to be restored from backups.
We do not believe any data was lost in the CVS repository.  We did lose any
pending messages in the mail queue as that does not get backed up.  At this
time, everything should be functional except for htdig.  The mailing list
archives on the web site are also out of date and will be updated soon.
New mail will update the archives correctly, however.  If you find any
other problems, please email

G++ is now using a new C++ ABI that represents classes more compactly,
uses shorter mangled names, and is optimized for higher run-time
performance.  The implementation of the new ABI was contributed by
Mark Mitchell, Nathan Sidwell, and Alexander Samuel of CodeSourcery,
LLC.
</dd>

<dt><b>November 18, 2000</b></dt>

GCC now supports ISO C99 declarations in <code>for</code> loops
(<code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) /* ... */</code>).  These are
only supported in C99 mode (command line options
<code>-std=gnu99</code> or <code>-std=c99</code>), which will be the
default in some future release, but not in GCC 3.0.
</dd>

<dt><b>November 14, 2000</b></dt>

Michael Matz has donated an implementation of the Lengauer and Tarjan
algorithm for computing dominators in the CFG.  This algorithm can
be significantly faster and more space efficient than our older
algorithm.  For one particularly nasty CFG from complex C++ code
(more than 77000 basic blocks) compile time dropped from more than
40 minutes to around 25 minutes.  Memory consumption was also
dramatically decreased.

We have now switched the C++ front end to use
<a href="libstdc++/">libstdc++-v3</a>, a new implementation of the ISO
Standard C++ Library which brings significant changes and improvements
over our ``old'' library. There still be may some rough edges, but we
are addressing problems as soon as we learn about them -- please help
testing and improving ``your'' ports!
</dd>

<dt><b>November 13, 2000</b></dt>

GCC now supports two more ISO C99 features:
<ul>
<li>The builtin boolean <code>_Bool</code> type and the
<code>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> header.  (GCC 2.95 had a non-conforming
<code>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> header; code that used that header will
not be binary compatible with code using the new conforming
version.)</li>
<li>Mixed declarations and code in compound statements.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><b>November 2, 2000</b></dt>

The C, C++ and Objective C front ends to GCC now use an integrated
preprocessor by default.  If all goes well, this will also be the
default mode for GCC 3.0.
</dd>

<dt><b>November 1, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Support for C99's <code>_Pragma</code> operator has been added to the
preprocessor.  This feature effectively makes it possible to have
<code>#pragma</code> directives be part of macro expansions, and to
have their arguments expanded too if necessary.

We would like to point out that GCC 2.96 is not a formal GCC release nor

Zack Weinberg of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, has contributed
modifications to the C, C++, and Objective C compilers which permit
them to use the C preprocessor library (cpplib) directly instead of
via a separate executable.

<p>This is not yet the default mode, but we hope it will be the
default in GCC 3.0.  When it is used the compiler will be faster
because it will not have to do lexical analysis twice, nor save the
preprocessed output to a temporary file.  In the future, this will
permit better error messages, and more detailed debugging information
particularly when complex macros are used.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Sep 11, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Neil Booth has contributed a new lexer and macro-expander for the C
preprocessor.  The lexer makes a single pass over the source files,
whereas previously it made two.  The macro expander operates on
lexical tokens instead of text strings.

<p>ISO C, C++, and Objective C use the new preprocessor.  Traditional
(K+R) C, Fortran, and Chill use an older implementation (taken from
GCC 1) which obeys the rules for pre-standard C preprocessing.  Either
version may be used to preprocess assembly language.</p>

<p>Stan Cox and Jason Eckhardt of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have
contributed a <a href="news/reorder.html">basic block reordering

<p>Richard Earnshaw of ARM Ltd, and Nick Clifton of Cygnus, a Red Hat

Michael Meissner and Nick Clifton of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have

<p>Michael Meissner and Richard Henderson of Cygnus, a Red Hat company,
have contributed a new if-conversion pass.  The code runs faster and
identifies more optimization opportunities than the old code.  In
addition, it also has support for conditional (predicated) execution,

is that Craig Burley will undertake the long-awaited <q>0.6 rewrite</q>
of the <code>g77</code> front end as his top priority for
the <code>gcc</code> 3.0 release,
