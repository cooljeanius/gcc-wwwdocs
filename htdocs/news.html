<dt><b>February 12, 2001</b></dt>
<dd>
Our CVS tree has branched for the GCC 3.0 release process and Mark Mitchell,
our release manager, has provided some <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2001-02/msg00403.html">guidelines for the
GCC 3.0 branch</a>.
</dd>

<dt><b>February 12, 2001</b></dt>
<dd>
Hans-Peter Nilsson, our search-engine volunteer, tweaked the search-engine to
include all mailing lists (including libstdc++ and GCJ). 
</dd>

<dt><b>January 28, 2001</b></dt>
<dd>
Tom Tromey has moved the Java mailing lists and web pages to gcc.gnu.org.
Now the GCJ project is fully integrated into GCC.
</dd>

<dt><b>January 21, 2001</b></dt>
<dd>
Neil Booth has contributed <a
href="news/dependencies.html">improvements</a> to the dependency
generation machinery of the C preprocessor, adding some new
functionality and correcting some undesirable behaviour of the old
implementation.
</dd>

<dt><b>January 15, 2001</b></dt>
<dd>
The GCC development tree is in a slush state, with the goal of
stabilization for branching for GCC 3.0.
</dd>

<dt><b>December 19, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
The runtime library for the <a href="java/">
Java front-end</a>, <code>libgcj</code>, has been moved into the GCC 
tree. This means that a separate download will no longer be required for 
Java support.
</dd>

<dt><b>December 4, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Nick Clifton of Red Hat has donated support for the Intel XScale
architecture.
</dd>

<dt><b>November 26, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
The C, C++ and Objective C front ends now use the integrated
preprocessor exclusively; their independent ability to tokenize an
input stream has been removed.
</dd>

<dt><b>November 18, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
G++ is now using a new C++ ABI that represents classes more compactly,
uses shorter mangled names, and is optimized for higher run-time
performance.  The implementation of the new ABI was contributed by
Mark Mitchell, Nathan Sidwell, and Alexander Samuel of CodeSourcery,
LLC.
</dd>

<dt><b>November 18, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
GCC now supports ISO C99 declarations in <code>for</code> loops
(<code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) /* ... */</code>).  These are
only supported in C99 mode (command line options
<code>-std=gnu99</code> or <code>-std=c99</code>), which will be the
default in some future release, but not in GCC 3.0.
</dd>

<dt><b>November 14, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Michael Matz has donated an implementation of the Lengauer and Tarjan
algorithm for computing dominators in the CFG.  This algorithm can
be significantly faster and more space efficient than our older
algorithm.  For one particularly nasty CFG from complex C++ code
(more than 77000 basic blocks) compile time dropped from more than
40 minutes to around 25 minutes.  Memory consumption was also
dramatically decreased.
</dd>

<dt><b>November 13, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
We have now switched the C++ frontend to use
<a href="libstdc++/">libstdc++-v3</a>, a new implementation of the ISO
Standard C++ Library which brings significant changes and improvements
over our ``old'' library. There still be may some rough edges, but we
are addressing problems as soon as we learn about them -- please help
testing and improving ``your'' ports!
</dd>

<dt><b>November 13, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
GCC now supports two more ISO C99 features:
<ul>
<li>The builtin boolean <code>_Bool</code> type and the
<code>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> header.  (GCC 2.95 had a non-conforming
<code>&lt;stdbool.h&gt;</code> header; code that used that header will
not be binary compatible with code using the new conforming
version.)</li>
<li>Mixed declarations and code in compound statements.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><b>November 2, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
The C, C++ and Objective C front-ends to GCC now use an integrated
preprocessor by default.  If all goes well, this will also be the
default mode for GCC 3.0.
</dd>

<dt><b>November 1, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Support for C99's <code>_Pragma</code> operator has been added to the
preprocessor.  This feature effectively makes it possible to have
<code>#pragma</code> directives be part of macro expansions, and to
have their arguments expanded too if necessary.
</dd>

<dt><b>October 6, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
We would like to point out that GCC 2.96 is not a formal GCC release nor
will there ever be such a release.  Rather, GCC 2.96 has been the code-
name for our development branch that will eventually become GCC 3.0.

</dd>

<dt><b>Sep 11, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Zack Weinberg of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, has contributed
modifications to the C, C++, and Objective C compilers which permit
them to use the C preprocessor library (cpplib) directly instead of
via a separate executable.

<p>This is not yet the default mode, but we hope it will be the
default in GCC 3.0.  When it is used the compiler will be faster
because it will not have to do lexical analysis twice, nor save the
preprocessed output to a temporary file.  In the future, this will
permit better error messages, and more detailed debugging information
particularly when complex macros are used.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>Sep 11, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Neil Booth has contributed a new lexer and macro-expander for the C
preprocessor.  The lexer makes a single pass over the source files,
whereas previously it made two.  The macro expander operates on
lexical tokens instead of text strings.

<p>ISO C, C++, and Objective C use the new preprocessor.  Traditional
(K+R) C, Fortran, and Chill use an older implementation (taken from
GCC 1) which obeys the rules for pre-standard C preprocessing.  Either
version may be used to preprocess assembly language.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>May 2, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Stan Cox and Jason Eckhardt of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have
contributed a <a href="news/reorder.html">basic block reordering
pass</a>.  The optimization can reposition basic blocks from across
the entire function in an attempt to reduce branch penalties and
enhance instruction cache efficiency.</p>

<p>Our thanks go to Michael Hayes, Jan Hubicka, and Graham Stott who
noticed or fixed defects or made other useful suggestions.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>May 1, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Richard Earnshaw of ARM Ltd, and Nick Clifton of Cygnus, a Red Hat
company, have contributed a new backend for the Arm and Thumb
processors.</p>

<p>The new backend combines code generation for the Arm, the Thumb and
the StrongArm into one compiler, with the target processor and
instruction sets being selectable via command line switches.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>April 30, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
Michael Meissner and Nick Clifton of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, have
contributed a port for the Mitsubishi D30V processor.

<p>Michael Meissner and Richard Henderson of Cygnus, a Red Hat company,
have contributed a new if-conversion pass.  The code runs faster and
identifies more optimization opportunities than the old code.  In
addition, it also has support for conditional (predicated) execution,
such as is found in the Intel IA-64 architecture, the ARM processors,
and numerous embedded LIW and DSP parts.</p>
</dd>

<dt><b>March 22, 2000</b></dt>
<dd>
The Steering Committee has appointed Mark Mitchell, of <a
href="http://www.codesourcery.com">CodeSourcery, LLC</a>, to manage the
GCC 3.0 release and as a new Steering Committe member.
CodeSourcery will be providing time from Mark, Alex Samuel, and other
personnel, to manage the release.  Thanks!
<p>
The Steering Committee and the GCC community owe Jeff Law an immense
debt for his work as release manager for the EGCS 1.0.x, 1.1.x, and

<br>Probably the most important decision reached at the meeting
is that Craig Burley will undertake the long-awaited <q>0.6 rewrite</q>
of the <code>g77</code> front end as his top priority for
the <code>gcc</code> 3.0 release,
rather than focusing on implementing some of the <q>most wanted</q>

  <b>gcc-cvs</b> and <b>egcs-patches</b>.

  <p>When a patch is checked into the CVS repository, a check-in notification
  message is automatically sent to the <b>gcc-cvs</b> mailing list.  This will
  allow developers to monitor changes as they are made.

  <p>Patch submissions should be sent to <b>egcs-patches</b> instead of the
  main egcs list.  This is primarily to help ensure that patch submissions do
  not get lost in the large volume of the main mailing list.

  Stanford has volunteered to host a high speed mirror for egcs.  This
  should significantly improve download speeds for releases and snapshots.
  Thanks Stanford and Tobin Brockett for the use of their network, disks
  and computing facilities!
