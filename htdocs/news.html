Zack Weinberg of Cygnus, a Red Hat company, has contributed
modifications to the C, C++, and Objective C compilers which permit
them to use the C preprocessor library (cpplib) directly instead of
via a separate executable.

<p>This is not yet the default mode, but we hope it will be the
default in GCC 3.0.  When it is used the compiler will be faster
because it will not have to do lexical analysis twice, nor save the
preprocessed output to a temporary file.  In the future, this will
permit better error messages, and more detailed debugging information
particularly when complex macros are used.</p>

Neil Booth has contributed a new lexer and macro-expander for the C

lexical tokens instead of text strings.

<p>ISO C, C++, and Objective C use the new preprocessor.  Traditional
(K+R) C, Fortran, and Chill use an older implementation (taken from
GCC 1) which obeys the rules for pre-standard C preprocessing.  Either
version may be used to preprocess assembly language.</p>

The sixth snapshot of the ongoing re-written C++ Standard Library has
been released.  It includes SGI STL 3.2, an automatically generated
<code>&lt;limits&gt;</code>, a partially re-written valarray, a working
stringbuf and stringstream (for basic types).

<code>g77</code> now supports optional run-time checking
of array subscript expressions
via the <code>-fbounds-check</code> compiler option.
(The same option applies to whatever bounds-checking
applies for other languages, such as Java.
The <code>-ffortran-bounds-check</code> option specifies
bounds-checking for Fortran code.)

Yes, it is not a hoax: The egcs steering committee is appointed official
GNU maintainer for GCC; the egcs team will be responsible for rolling out
future GCC releases.

<br>This will require some changes in policy and procedures for the project.
We will provide more information on those changes as they are available.

Through the efforts of John Wehle and Bernd Schmidt, GCC will now attempt to
keep the stack 64bit aligned on the x86 and allocate doubles on 64bit
boundaries.  This can significantly improve floating point performance on the
x86.  Work will continue on aligning the stack and floating point values in
the stack.

  <p>When a patch is checked into the CVS repository, a check-in notification
  message is automatically sent to the <b>gcc-cvs</b> mailing list.  This will
  allow developers to monitor changes as they are made.</p>

  <p>Patch submissions should be sent to <b>egcs-patches</b> instead of the
  main egcs list.  This is primarily to help ensure that patch submissions do
  not get lost in the large volume of the main mailing list.</p>
