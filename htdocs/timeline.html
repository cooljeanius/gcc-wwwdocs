The egcs project maintains two kinds of version numbers. one is of the
form 2.9x.yy and indicates a relationship between gcc2 and egcs; this
number can be also used to test whether a program is compiled with
egcs.  Change in the 9x minor number is infrequent; the subminor (yy)
is increased with every snapshot (roughly every week).
<p>
The other version number counts egcs releases (as compared to
development snapshots). So far, there have been releases 1.0.x, and
1.1.x. The table below gives a relationship between all these numbers.
