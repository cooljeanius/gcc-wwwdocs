<h1>Read-write SVN access</h1>

<p>We have read/write access to the SVN repository available for
significant developers. Maintainers are also encouraged to <a
  href="bugs/management.html">edit our bugs database</a>.

Read/write access to the wwwdocs repository containing GCC
www documents is still done using <a href="cvswrite.html">CVS</a>
</p>

<h2><a name="authenticated">Authenticated access</a></h2>

<p>We provide authenticated access via the SSH protocol.</p> 

<p>If you already have an account on sources.redhat.com, please send
email to <code>overseers(at)gcc.gnu.org</code> with a request
for access to the GCC repository.  Include the name of the person who
is sponsoring your access.
Else use <a
href="http://sources.redhat.com/cgi-bin/pdw/ps_form.cgi">this form</a>
to supply your SSH public key (which you can generate via the
<code>ssh-keygen</code> program) and other details.</p>

<p>Once we have this information we will set up an account on
gcc.gnu.org and inform you by mail.  At this point you
should be able to check out a tree with SVN and add yourself to the
MAINTAINERS file to test write access, following the instructions below.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="setup">Setting up your local SVN tree</a></h2>

<p>Once your account has been set up, check out the GCC sources by 
issuing the command:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>
svn co svn+ssh://:<i>username</i>@gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk gcc
</code></p></blockquote>

<p>where <i>username</i> is your user name at gcc.gnu.org.</p>

<p>It is also possible to convert an existing SVN tree to use SSH by
using svn switch --relocate:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>
svn switch --relocate svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc \
svn+ssh://<i>username</i>@gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc
</code></p></blockquote>

<p>To avoid the nuisance of having to supply your passphrase for each
operation, you may want to use <code>ssh-agent</code>(1) and
<code>ssh-add</code>(1).</p>

<p>To avoid messages about (lack of) X11 forwarding, put in your
<samp>$HOME/.ssh/config</samp> an entry like:</p>

<blockquote><p><code>
Host gcc.gnu.org<br />
ForwardX11 no
</code></p></blockquote>

<hr />
<h2><a name="policies">Write access policies</a></h2>

<p>The GCC project grants some developers various levels of write
access to the GCC master sources.  SVN doesn't provide fine grained
control over access to the repository; therefore, we depend on each
developer to follow the appropriate policies.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Global write permission.</dt>
  <dd><p>A very limited number of developers have global write
  permission over the entire repository.  They may check in changes to
  any part of the compiler without approval from anyone else.  They
  may also approve other people's changes to any part of the
  compiler.</p></dd>

  <dt>Localized write permission.</dt>
  <dd><p>This is for people who have primary responsibility for ports,
  front ends, or significant hunks of code in the compiler.  These
  folks are allowed to make changes in code they maintain without
  approval from anyone else, and approve other people's changes in
  those files. They must get approval from the appropriate maintainers
  for changes elsewhere in the compiler.</p>

  <p>Maintainers of a port maintain the files in config/<i>port</i>/,
  the configure fragments for the port, documentation for the port and
  test cases for features or bugs specific to this port.  Port
  maintainers do not have approval rights in other files.</p></dd>

  <dt>Write after approval.</dt>
  <dd><p>This is folks that make regular contributions, but do not
  fall into one of the two previous categories.  People with write
  after approval need to submit their patches to the list; once the
  patches have been approved by the appropriate maintainers the
  patches may be checked into the GCC sources.  The steering committee
  or a well-established GCC maintainer (including, but not limited to
  global write maintainers) can <a href="#authenticated">
  approve for write access</a> any person with GNU copyright assignment
  papers in place and known to submit good patches.</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The list of folks with write access to the repository can be found
in the MAINTAINERS file in the GCC distribution.</p>

<p>When you have checked in a patch exactly as it has been approved,
you do not need to tell that to people -- including the approver.
People interested in when a particular patch is committed can check
SVN or the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-SVN/">gcc-SVN</a>
list.</p>

<h3>Free for all</h3>

<p>The following changes can be made by everyone with SVN write access:</p>

<p>Fixes for obvious typos in ChangeLog files, docs, web pages, comments
and similar stuff.  Just check in the fix and copy it to
<code>gcc-patches</code>.  We don't want to get overly anal-retentive
about checkin policies.</p>

<p>Similarly, no outside approval is needed to revert a patch that you
checked in.</p>

<p><a href="codingconventions.html#upstream">Importing files maintained
outside the tree from their official versions</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#branches">Creating and using a branch</a> for development,
including outside the parts of the compiler one maintains, provided that
changes on the branch have copyright assignments on file.  Merging such
developments back to the mainline still needs approval in the usual way.</p>


<hr />
<h2><a name="testing">Testing changes</a></h2>

<p>All changes must be tested according to the 
<a href="contribute.html#testing">instructions for testing patches</a>
before they are checked in.  If you wrote the patch yourself, you
should test it yourself, unless there is a reason why someone else
must do it for you (for instance, if you are fixing a problem on a
system you do not have access to).  If you are checking in a patch for
someone else, you only need to test it if they did not.</p>

<p>You must test exactly the change you intend to check in; it is not
good enough to have tested an earlier variant.  (Unless the only
changes from the earlier variant are formatting and comment changes;
if there are <strong>any</strong> changes to the code itself you
should re-bootstrap.)  It is a good idea to re-test patches which were
submitted a long time ago before applying them, even if nothing
appears to have changed.</p>

<p>When you post your change to <code>gcc-patches</code>, state the
canonical name(s) of the platform(s) you used for testing.</p>

<p>These rules are designed to ensure that checked-in code does not
contain bugs that prevent other people from continuing to get their
work done.  There will always be bugs, but these rules help to
minimize the amount of time where the tree does not build at
all. Repeated failure to adhere to these rules could result in the
revocation of check-in privileges by the Steering Committee.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="checkin">Checking in a change</a></h2>

<p>The following is meant to provide a very quick overview of how to
check in a change.  It is not meant to be a replacement for the SVN
manual but instead a supplement.  The SVN manual is available both
as part of the SVN source distribution, as well as at 
<a href="http://svnbook.com">The SVN book homepage</a></p>

<p>In all the commands listed below, you can give an explicit list of
filenames to the SVN command.  We recommend you list files explicitly
when performing checkins to avoid accidental checkins of local
code.</p>

<p>We prefer that each SVN checkin be of a complete, single logical
change, which may affect multiple files.  The log message for that
checkin should be the complete ChangeLog entry for the change.  This
makes it easier to correlate changes across files, and minimizes the
time the repository is inconsistent.  If you have several unrelated
changes, you should check them in with separate SVN commit
commands.</p>

<ol>
<li>Sync your sources with the master repository via "<code>svn
update</code>" before attempting a checkin; this will save you a little
time if someone else has modified that file since the last time you
synced your sources.  It will also identify any files in your local
tree that you have modified.</li>

<li>Apply the patch to your local tree and update the ChangeLog file.
Use the current date/time for the ChangeLog entry, not the time that
the patch was submitted.</li>

<li>Make sure to rebuild any generated files that would be affected by
the patch.  Make sure to check them in along with the files explicitly
modified by the patch.</li>

<li>We recommend using "<code>svn diff</code>" after applying a patch to a
local tree.  Review the output to make sure that only the changes you
wanted to check in will be checked in.  Also check to see if the
copyright dates need to be updated.</li>

<li>Use "<code>svn commit</code>" to check in the patch.  You can enter
the log message via the "<code>-m</code>" argument to commit, or wait for
the editor window to appear and enter the log message in the editor
window.</li>

<li>After exiting the editor, SVN will connect to the GCC SVN server
and check in your changes.  When your prompt returns the checkin is
finished.  A message will be sent to the gcc-cvs mailing
list indicating that a change was made.  SVN will provide a message if
an error occurs and it will not check in any files.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="example">Example check-in session</a></h2>

<p>Here's an actual check-in session for a patch John Carr recently
sent to the GCC list.  This was the ChangeLog for his change:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
Sun Feb  8 08:02:13 1998  John Carr  &lt;jfc@mit.edu>

   * bitmap.c (bitmap_debug_file): HOST_PTR_PRINTF converts a pointer,
   not a HOST_WIDE_INT.

   * calls.c (expand_call): Change test of expand_inline_function
   return value to stop compiler warning.

   * genattrtab.c (RTL_HASH): Cast pointer to long, not HOST_WIDE_INT.
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>First, I sync my local repository.</h3>

<blockquote><pre>
[/law/gcc] svn update
? libobjc
? gcc/.ada
? gcc/jump.c.SAVE
? gcc/loop.c.SAVE
M MAINTAINERS
M Makefile.in
M gcc/loop.c
M gcc/cp/parse.c
M gcc/objc/Make-lang.in
M gcc/objc/Makefile.in
At revision 105932
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The question marks indicate files in my local repository that are
not part of the official sources.  The "M" indicates files I've
changed locally for some unrelated work -- thus I have to be careful
to avoid checking them in.  A "U" would have indicated a file that SVN
updated because my local copy was out of date relative to the master
sources.</p>

<p>The local repository is now up to date.</p>

<h3>Apply the patch to the local source</h3>

<blockquote><pre>

<h3>Add ChangeLog entry by hand</h3>

<p>ChangeLog entries should be handled as straight text;
patches against ChangeLogs rarely apply correctly.</p>

<h3>Review changes for correctness</h3>

<p>The patch and its associated <code>ChangeLog</code> entry are in my
local tree; now I run <code>svn diff</code> on the modified files and
review the output, verifying that it only contains the changes we want.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
[/law/gcc/gcc] svn diff bitmap.c calls.c genattrtab.c
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Update Copyrights</h3>

<p>Review the changed files to see if any copyrights need updating, in
this particular case all three needed their copyrights updated.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
[/law/gcc/gcc] vi bitmap.c calls.c genattrtab.c
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Commit the changes to the central repository</h3>

<blockquote><pre>
[/law/gcc/gcc] svn commit ChangeLog bitmap.c calls.c genattrtab.c
</pre></blockquote>

<p>My editor starts and I enter the log message; the lines starting
with <code>This line, and those below, will be ignored</code> are automatically 
added by SVN and will be automatically removed:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
        * bitmap.c (bitmap_debug_file): HOST_PTR_PRINTF converts a pointer,
        not a HOST_WIDE_INT.

        * calls.c (expand_call): Change test of expand_inline_function
        return value to stop compiler warning.

        * genattrtab.c (RTL_HASH): Cast pointer to long, not HOST_WIDE_INT.

--This line, and those below, will be ignored--
M    ChangeLog
M    bitmap.c

<p>Now write &amp; quit from the editor, and SVN will start the actual
checkin process....</p>

<p>And that's it!</p>

<h2><a name="branches">Creating branches</a></h2>

<p>To create a branch for development, simply copy the trunk directory
to a directory in /branches as follows:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
svn cp svn+ssh://<i>username</i>@gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk \
    svn+ssh://<i>username</i>@gcc.gnu.org/svn/branches/$BRANCH
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Also, please document such branches at
<a href="svn.html#devbranches">svn.html#devbranches</a>.
