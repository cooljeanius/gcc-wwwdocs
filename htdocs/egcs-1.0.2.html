<p>March 16, 1998

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of egcs-1.0.2.

<p>egcs is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers using
an open development model to accelerate development and testing of GNU
compilers and runtime libraries.

<p>egcs-1.0.2 is a minor update to the egcs-1.0.1 compiler to fix a several
serious problems in egcs-1.0.1.

<ul>
  <li> Memory comsumption significantly reduced, especially for templates
       and inline functions.
  <li> libstdc++ in the egcs release has been updated and should be link
       compatable with libstdc++-2.8.
  <li> Various libio fixes to work better with Linux.
  <li> Fix problems with duplicate symbols on systems that do not
       support weak symbols, particularly in libstdc++.
  <li> Memory corruption bug and undefined symbols in bastring have been fixed.
       bastring have been fixed.
  <li> Fix various problems with glibc2.1.
  <li> Fix long double problems on x86 (exposed by glibc)
  <li> Various exception handling fixes, including fixing EH on NetBSD ports.
  <li> Several changes to collect2 to fix many problems with AIX.
  <li> x86 ports define i386 again to keep imake happy.
  <li> Fix loop optimization bug exposed by rs6000/ppc port.
  <li> Define __ELF__ for rs6000/linux.
  <li> Fix -mcall-linux problem on rs6000/linux.
  <li> Fix stdarg/vararg problem for rs6000/linux.
  <li> Allow autoconf to select a proper install problem on AIX 3.1.
  <li> Fix stdarg bug for irix6.
  <li> Allow egcs to build on irix5 without the gnu assembler.
  <li> Fix compiler crash for omitted bound in Fortran CASE statement.
  <li> Add missing entries to g77 lang-options.
  <li> Fix problem with -fpedantic in the g77 compiler.
  <li> Fix "backspace" problem with g77 on alphas.
  <li> Fix x86 backend problem with Fortran literals and -fpic.
  <li> Fix some of the problems with negative subscripts for g77 on alphas.
  <li> Fixes for Fortran builds on cygwin32/mingw32.
  <li> Fix problem with static linking on sco5.
  <li> Fix bootstrap on sco5 with native compiler.
  <li> Fix compiler abort for very log thunk names.
  <li> Fix fixincludes handling of math.h on SunOS.
  <li> Fix some undefined symbol problems in dwarf1 debug support.
  <li> Fix to avoid potential code generation problems in jump.c.
  <li> Fix for abort building newlib on H8 series.
</ul>


<p>An important goal of egcs is to allow wide scale testing of new features
and optimizations which are still under development.  However, egcs has been
carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to most gcc releases.

<p>egcs-1.0.2 is based on an August 2, 1997 snapshot of the gcc-2.8 development
sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found in gcc-2.8.


<p>egcs also contains many improvements and features not found in gcc-2.7 or
gcc-2.8.
<ul>
  <li>Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
  linux systems!
  <li>The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of 
  <a href="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL">SGI's STL release.</a>
  <li>Integrated GNU Fortran compiler
  <li>New instruction scheduler
  <li>New alias analysis code
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="features.html"> new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features found in egcs-1.0.x releases.

<p>The egcs-1.0.2 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel directory
of the egcs-1.0.2 distribution).  However, we also keep the most up to date
<a href="install/index.html"> installation instructions </a>
and <a href="buildstat.html"> build/test status </a> on our web page.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.

<p>And, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html"> caveats </a> to using egcs.

<p>Update: Big thanks to Stanford for providing a high speed link for

too numerous to mention by name.
