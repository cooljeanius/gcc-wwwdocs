<h1><a href="conduct.html">GCC Code of Conduct</a> Reporting Guide</h1>

<h2><span style="color: red;"><strong>NOTE</strong></span><strong>: The Code
of Conduct Committee, and the formal reporting and response procedures, are not
yet fully established.  The below are the currently planned procedures for when
the committee is in place.</strong></h2>

<p>If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you
report it to the CoC committee by
emailing <a href="mailto:conduct@gcc.gnu.org">conduct@gcc.gnu.org</a>. <strong>All
reports will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by applicable
law.</strong> In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need
to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all reporters will remain
confidential unless they instruct us otherwise.</p>

<p>If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the space
where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to still
report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports where we decide to
take no action, rather than miss a report of an actual violation. We do not
look negatively on you for a report made in good faith if we find the incident
is not a violation. And knowing
about incidents that are not violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also
help us to improve the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.</p>

<p>In your report please include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up)</li>
  <li>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If
  there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as
  well.</li>
  <li>When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.</li>
  <li>Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record
  (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a
  link.</li>
  <li>Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.</li>
  <li>If you believe this incident is ongoing.</li>
  <li>Any other information you believe we should have.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What happens after you file a report?</h3>
<p>You will receive an email from the Code of Conduct Committee acknowledging
receipt. We aim to acknowledge receipt within 24 hours (and ideally
much sooner than that).</p>

<p>The committee will then meet to review the report, and gather all available
information about the incident from the individuals involved and any electronic
records.</p>

<p>If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical
safety, the committee's immediate priority will be to protect everyone
involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until we believe that
the situation has ended and that everyone is physically safe.</p>

<p>Once the committee has a complete account of the events they will make a
decision as to how to respond. Responses may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred).</li>
  <li>An offer to mediate between the individual(s) involved.</li>
  <li>A private request or reprimand from the committee to one or more of the
  individual(s) involved.</li>
  <li>A public request or reprimand.</li>
  <li>An imposed vacation (e.g. asking someone to "take a week off" from a
  mailing list or IRC).</li>
  <li>A permanent or temporary ban from some or all project spaces (mailing
  lists, IRC, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with either
a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet resolved.</p>

<p>Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original reporter
to let them know what action (or no action) we'll be taking. We'll take into
account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of our response, but
we don't guarantee we'll act on it.</p>

<p>Finally, the committee will make a report on the situation to the Steering
Committee, who may choose to make a public report of the incident.</p>

<p>For more detail, see the <a href="conduct-response.html">Response Guide</a>.

<h3>What if your report concerns a possible violation by a committee member?</h3>

<p>If your report concerns a current member of the Code of Conduct committee,
you may not feel comfortable sending your report to the committee, as all
members will see the report.</p>

<p>In that case, you can make a report directly to the current chair of the
Code of Conduct committee. Their email address is listed on the Code of Conduct
Committee page. The chair will follow the usual enforcement process with the
other members, but will exclude the member(s) that the report concerns from any
discussion or decision making.</p>

<p>If your report concerns the chair of the committee, please send your report
directly to another member, or to a member of the Steering Committee.</p>

<h3>Reconsideration</h3>

<p>Any of the parties directly involved or affected can request reconsideration
of the committee's decision. To make such a request, contact a member of the
Steering Committee with your request and motivation.</p>
