<h1>EGCS 1.0 features</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Core compiler is based on the gcc2 development tree from Aug 2, 1997, so
  we have most of the
  <a href="features-2.8.html">features found in GCC 2.8</a>.</li>
  <li>Integrated GNU Fortran compiler based on g77-0.5.22-19970929.</li>
  <li>Vast improvements in the C++ compiler; so many they have 
  <a href="c++features.html">page of their own!</a></li>
  <li>Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
  GNU/Linux systems!</li>
  <li>New instruction scheduler from IBM Haifa which includes support for
  function wide instruction scheduling as well as superscalar scheduling.</li>
  <li>Significantly improved alias analysis code.</li>
  <li>Improved register allocation for two address machines.</li>
  <li>Significant code generation improvements for Fortran code on Alphas.</li>
  <li>Various optimizations from the g77 project as well as improved loop
  optimizations.</li>
  <li>Dwarf2 debug format support for some targets.</li>
  <li>egcs libstdc++ includes the SGI STL implementation without changes.</li>
  <li>As a result of these and other changes, egcs libstc++ is not binary
  compatible with previous releases of libstdc++.</li>
  <li>Various new ports -- UltraSPARC, Irix6.2 &amp; Irix6.3 support,
  The SCO Openserver 5 family (5.0.{0,2,4} and Internet FastStart 1.0 and 1.1),
  Support for RTEMS on several embedded targets, 
  Support for arm-linux,
  Mitsubishi M32R, Hitachi H8/S, Matsushita MN102 and MN103, NEC V850,
  Sparclet, Solaris &amp; GNU/Linux on PowerPCs, etc.<br /></li>
  <li>Integrated testsuites for gcc, g++, g77, libstdc++ and libio.</li>
  <li>RS6000/PowerPC ports generate code which can run on all RS6000/PowerPC
  variants by default.</li>
  <li>-mcpu= and -march= switches for the x86 port to allow better control
  over how the x86 port generates code.</li>
  <li>Includes the template repository patch (aka repo patch); note the new
  template code makes repo obsolete for ELF systems using gnu-ld such
  as GNU/Linux.</li>
  <li>Plus the usual assortment of bugfixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
