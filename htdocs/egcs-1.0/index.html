</p>

<p>EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers using
an open development model to accelerate development and testing of GNU
compilers and runtime libraries.</p>

<p>An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of experimental
features and optimizations; therefore, EGCS contains some features and
optimizations which are still under development.  However, EGCS has been
carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to most GCC releases.</p>

<p>EGCS 1.0 is based on an August 2, 1997 snapshot of the GCC 2.8 development
sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found in GCC 2.8.</p>

<p>EGCS 1.0 also contains many improvements and features not found in
GCC 2.7 and even the GCC 2.8 series (which was released after the original
EGCS 1.0 release).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
  GNU/Linux systems!</li>
  <li>The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of 
  SGI's STL release.</li>
  <li>Integrated GNU Fortran compiler.</li>
  <li>New instruction scheduler.</li>
  <li>New alias analysis code.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="features.html">new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features.</p>


<p>EGCS 1.0.1 is a minor update to the EGCS 1.0 compiler to fix a few critical
bugs and add support for Red Hat 5.0 Linux.  Changes since the EGCS 1.0
release:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p> Add support for Red Hat 5.0 Linux and better support for Linux
  systems using glibc2.</p>

  <p>Many programs failed to link when compiled with EGCS 1.0 on Red Hat 5.0 or
  on systems with newer versions of glibc2.  EGCS 1.0.1 should fix these
  problems.</p></li>

  <li><p> Compatibility with both EGCS 1.0 and GCC 2.8 libgcc exception handling
  interfaces.</p>

  <p>To avoid future compatibility problems, we strongly urge anyone who is
  planning on distributing shared libraries that contain C++ code to upgrade
  to EGCS 1.0.1 first.</p>

  <p>Soon after EGCS 1.0 was released, the GCC developers made some
  incompatible changes in libgcc's exception handling interfaces.  These
  changes were needed to solve problems on some platforms.  This means that
  GCC 2.8.0, when released, will not be seamlessly compatible with shared
  libraries built by EGCS 1.0.  The reason is that the libgcc.a in GCC 2.8.0
  will not contain a function needed by the old interface.</p>

  <p>The result of this is that there may be compatibility problems with shared
  libraries built by EGCS 1.0 when used with GCC 2.8.0.</p>

  <p>With EGCS 1.0.1, generated code uses the new (GCC 2.8.0) interface, and
  libgcc.a has the support routines for both the old and the new interfaces
  (so EGCS 1.0.1 and EGCS 1.0 code can be freely mixed, and EGCS 1.0.1 and
  GCC 2.8.0 code can be freely mixed).</p>

  <p>The maintainers of GCC 2.x have decided against including seamless support
  for the old interface in 2.8.0, since it was never "official", so to avoid
  future compatibility problems we recommend against distributing any shared
  libraries built by EGCS 1.0 that contain C++ code (upgrade to 1.0.1 and
  use that).</p></li>

  <li><p> Various bugfixes in the x86, hppa, mips, and rs6000/ppc back ends.</p>

  <p>The x86 changes fix code generation errors exposed when building
  glibc2 and the usual GNU/Linux dynamic linker (ld.so).</p>

  <p>The hppa change fixes a compiler abort when configured for use
  with RTEMS.</p>

  <p>The MIPS changes fix problems with the definition of LONG_MAX on
  newer systems, allow for command line selection of the target ABI,
  and fix one code generation problem.</p>

  <p>The rs6000/ppc change fixes some problems with passing structures
  to varargs/stdarg functions.</p></li>

  <li><p>A few machine independent bugfixes, mostly to fix code generation
  errors when building Linux kernels or glibc.</p></li>

  <li><p>Fix a few critical exception handling and template bugs in the C++
  compiler.</p></li>

  <li><p>Fix Fortran namelist bug on alphas.</p></li>

  <li><p>Fix build problems on x86-solaris systems.</p></li>

<p>The EGCS 1.0 releases include installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel directory
of the distribution).  However, we also keep the most up to date
installation instructions
and <a href="buildstat.html">build/test status</a> on our web page.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>And, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using EGCS.</p>

<p>Update: Big thanks to Stanford for providing a high speed link for
downloading EGCS (go.cygnus.com)!</p>
  
<p>Download EGCS from ftp.cygnus.com (USA California) or
go.cygnus.com (USA California -- High speed link provided by Stanford).</p>

<p>The EGCS 1.0 release is also available many mirror sites.<br />
<a href="../mirrors.html">Goto mirror list to find a closer site</a></p>

<p>We'd like to thank the numerous people that have contributed new
features, test results, bugfixes, etc.  Unfortunately, they're far
too numerous to mention by name.</p>
