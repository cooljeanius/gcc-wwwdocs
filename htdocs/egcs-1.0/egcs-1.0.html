<h1 align="center">EGCS 1.0</h1>

<p>December 3, 1997

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.0.

<p>EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers using
an open development model to accelerate development and testing of GNU
compilers and runtime libraries.

<p>An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of experimental
features and optimizations; therefore, EGCS contains some features and
optimizations which are still under development.  However, EGCS has been
carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to most GCC releases.

<p>EGCS 1.0 is based on an August 2, 1997 snapshot of the GCC 2.8 development
sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found in GCC 2.8.


<p>EGCS 1.0 also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC 2.7
and even the soon to be released GCC 2.8 compilers.
<ul>
  <li>Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
  linux systems!
  <li>The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of 
  SGI's STL release.
  <li>Integrated GNU Fortran compiler
  <li>New instruction scheduler
  <li>New alias analysis code
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="features.html">new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features.

<p>The EGCS 1.0 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel directory
of the EGCS 1.0 distribution).  However, we also keep the most up to date
<a href="../install/index.html">installation instructions</a>
and <a href="buildstat.html">build/test status</a> on our web page.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.

<p>And, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using EGCS.

<p>Update: The T1 into our main California offices has been 100% saturated
since shortly after the release.  We've added an EGCS 1.0 mirror at our
Massachusetts office to help share the load.  We also encourage folks to
use the many mirrors available throughout the world.

<p>Update: Big thanks to Stanford for providing a high speed link for
downloading EGCS (go.cygnus.com)!
  
<p>Download EGCS from ftp.cygnus.com (USA California) or
go.cygnus.com (USA California -- High speed link provided by Stanford).

<p>The EGCS 1.0 release should be available on most mirror sites by now.<br>

<p>We'd like to thank the numerous people that have contributed new
features, test results, bugfixes, etc.  Unfortunately, they're far
too numerous to mention by name.
