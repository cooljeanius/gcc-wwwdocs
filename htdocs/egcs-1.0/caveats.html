<h1>EGCS 1.0 Caveats</h1>

<ul>
  <li>EGCS has an integrated libstdc++, but does not have an integrated libg++.
  Furthermore old libg++ releases will not work with egc; HJ Lu has made a 
  libg++-2.8.1.2 available which may work with EGCS.
  <br>Note most C++ programs only need libstdc++.

  <li>Note that using -pedantic or -Wreturn-type can cause an explosion in the
  amount of memory needed for template-heavy C++ code, such as code that uses
  STL.  Also note that -Wall includes -Wreturn-type, so if you use -Wall you
  will need to specify -Wno-return-type to turn it off.

  <li> Exception handling may not work with shared libraries, particularly
  on alphas, hppas, and mips based platforms.  Exception handling is known
  to work on x86-linux platforms with shared libraries.

  <li> Some versions of the Linux kernel have bugs which prevent them
  from being compiled or from running when compiled by EGCS.  See
  <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/fom_serv/cache/24.html">the FAQ</a>
  for additional information.

  <li> In general, EGCS is more rigorous about rejecting invalid C++ code
  or deprecated C++ constructs than G++ 2.7.  As a result it may be necessary
  to fix C++ code before it will compile with EGCS.

  <li>G++ is also aggressively tracking the C++ standard; as a result code
  which was previously valid (and thus accepted by other compilers and older
  versions of G++) may no longer be accepted.

  <li>EGCS 1.0 may not work with Red Hat Linux 5.0 on all targets.  EGCS 1.0.x
  and later releases should work with Red Hat Linux 5.0.
</ul>
