<p>We are pleased to announce the release of EGCS 1.0.2.</p>

<p>EGCS is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers using
an open development model to accelerate development and testing of GNU
compilers and runtime libraries.</p>

    <li> Fix various problems with glibc2.1.</li>
    <li> Fix loop optimization bug exposed by rs6000/ppc port.</li>
    <li> Fix to avoid potential code generation problems in jump.c.</li>
    <li> Fix some undefined symbol problems in dwarf1 debug support.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li> g++/libstdc++ improvements and fixes
  <ul>
    <li> libstdc++ in the EGCS release has been updated and should be link
         compatible with libstdc++-2.8.</li>
    <li> Various fixes in libio/libstdc++ to work better on Linux systems.</li>
    <li> Fix problems with duplicate symbols on systems that do not
	 support weak symbols.</li>

    <li> Add missing entries to g77 lang-options.</li>
    <li> Fix problem with -fpedantic in the g77 compiler.</li>
    <li> Fix "backspace" problem with g77 on alphas.</li>
    <li> Fix x86 backend problem with Fortran literals and -fpic.</li>
    <li> Fix some of the problems with negative subscripts for g77 on 
         alphas.</li>
    <li> Fixes for Fortran builds on cygwin32/mingw32.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li> platform specific improvements and fixes
  <ul>

     <li> Fix stdarg/vararg problem for rs6000/linux.</li>
     <li> Allow autoconf to select a proper install problem on AIX 3.1.</li>
     <li> m68k port support includes -mcpu32 option as well as cpu32 
          multilibs.</li>
     <li> Fix stdarg bug for irix6.</li>
     <li> Allow EGCS to build on irix5 without the gnu assembler.</li>
     <li> Fix problem with static linking on sco5.</li>
     <li> Fix bootstrap on sco5 with native compiler.</li>
     <li> Fix for abort building newlib on H8 target.</li>
     <li> Fix fixincludes handling of math.h on SunOS.</li>
     <li> Minor fix for motorola 3300 m68k systems.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>


<p>An important goal of EGCS is to allow wide scale testing of new features
and optimizations which are still under development.  However, EGCS has been
carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to most GCC releases.</p>

<p>EGCS 1.0.2 is based on an August 2, 1997 snapshot of the GCC 2.8 development
sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found in GCC 2.8.</p>


<p>EGCS also contains many improvements and features not found in GCC 2.7 or
GCC 2.8.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
  linux systems!</li>
  <li>The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of 
  SGI's STL release.</li>
  <li>Integrated GNU Fortran compiler.</li>
  <li>New instruction scheduler.</li>
  <li>New alias analysis code.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="features.html">new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features found in EGCS 1.0.x releases.</p>

<p>The EGCS 1.0.2 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel directory
of the EGCS 1.0.2 distribution).  However, we also keep the most up to date
<a href="../install/index.html">installation instructions</a>
and <a href="buildstat.html">build/test status</a> on our web page.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>And, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using EGCS.</p>

<p>Update: Big thanks to Stanford for providing a high speed link for
downloading EGCS (go.cygnus.com)!</p>
  
<p>Download EGCS from ftp.cygnus.com (USA California) or
go.cygnus.com (USA California -- High speed link provided by Stanford).</p>

<p>The EGCS 1.0.2 release is also available on many mirror sites.<br />
<a href="../mirrors.html">Goto mirror list to find a closer site</a></p>

<p>We'd like to thank the numerous people that have contributed new
features, test results, bugfixes, etc.  Unfortunately, they're far
too numerous to mention by name.</p>
