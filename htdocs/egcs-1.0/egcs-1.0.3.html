<p>May 15, 1998

<p>We are pleased to announce the release of egcs-1.0.3.

<p>egcs is a collaborative effort involving several groups of hackers using
an open development model to accelerate development and testing of GNU
compilers and runtime libraries.

<p>egcs-1.0.3 is a minor update to the egcs-1.0.2 compiler to fix a few
problems reported by Red Hat for builds of Red Hat 5.1.

<ul>
  <li> Generic bugfixes: 
  <ul>
    <li> Fix a typo in the libio library which resulted in incorrect
         behavior of istream::get.
    <li> Fix the Fortran negative array index problem.
    <li> Fix a major problem with the ObjC runtime thread support exposed
	 by glibc2.
    <li> Reduce memory consumption of the Haifa scheduler.
  </ul>
  <li> Target specific bugfixes:
  <ul>
    <li> Fix one x86 floating point code generation bug exposed by
         glibc2 builds.
    <li> Fix one x86 internal compiler error exposed by glibc2 builds.
    <li> Fix profiling bugs on the Alpha.
    <li> Fix ImageMagick & emacs 20.2 build problems on the Alpha.
    <li> Fix rs6000/ppc bug when converting values from integer types
         to floating point types.
  </ul>
</ul>


<p>An important goal of egcs is to allow wide scale testing of new features
and optimizations which are still under development.  However, egcs has been
carefully tested and should be comparable in quality to most gcc releases.

<p>egcs-1.0.3 is based on an August 2, 1997 snapshot of the gcc-2.8 development
sources; it contains nearly all of the new features found in gcc-2.8.


<p>egcs also contains many improvements and features not found in gcc-2.7 or
gcc-2.8.
<ul>
  <li>Integrated C++ runtime libraries, including support for most major
  GNU/Linux systems!
  <li>The integrated libstdc++ library includes a verbatim copy of 
  <a href="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL">SGI's STL release instead
  of a modified copy.</a>
  <li>Integrated GNU Fortran compiler
  <li>New instruction scheduler
  <li>New alias analysis code
</ul>

<p>See the <a href="features.html"> new features</a> page for a more complete
list of new features found in egcs-1.0.x releases.

<p>The egcs-1.0.3 release includes installation instructions in both HTML
and plaintext forms (see the INSTALL directory in the toplevel directory
of the egcs-1.0.3 distribution).  However, we also keep the most up to date
<a href="../install/index.html"> installation instructions </a>
and <a href="buildstat.html"> build/test status </a> on our web page.  We
will update those pages as new information becomes available.

<p>And, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html"> caveats </a> to using egcs.

<p>Update: Big thanks to Stanford for providing a high speed link for
downloading egcs (go.cygnus.com)!

too numerous to mention by name.
