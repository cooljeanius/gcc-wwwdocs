<h1>Porting to GCC 10</h1>

<p>
The GCC 10 release series differs from previous GCC releases in
<a href="changes.html">a number of ways</a>. Some of these are a result
of bug fixing, and some old behaviors have been intentionally changed
to support new standards, or relaxed in standards-conforming ways to
facilitate compilation or run-time performance.
</p>

<p>
Some of these changes are user visible and can cause grief when
porting to GCC 10. This document is an effort to identify common issues
and provide solutions. Let us know if you have suggestions for improvements!
</p>

<h3 id="argument-mismatch">Argument mismatches</h3>

<p>
GCC 10 now rejects argument mismatches occurring in the same source file.
Those are not permitted by the Fortran standard and in general have the
potential to generate invalid code.  However, the Fortran standard does permit
passing an array element or a scalar string (of default character kind or of
<code>c_char</code> kind) as actual argument to an array dummy argument.
(For the exact wording, see the Fortran standard on argument association;
in particular, Fortran 2018, Sect. 15.5.2.4, Para. 4.)
</p>

<p>
Depending on their nature, argument mismatches have the potential to cause the
generation of invalid code and, hence, should be investigated.  The most common
reason that code fails due to newly enforced check is the following:  instead of
using an array element as actual argument, a scalar is used; one solution is to
replace the scalar by a size-one array.  (This should be passed as a whole as
there is no point in passing it as array element.)  Additionally, check that the
code indeed only accesses this single element.  —  Other mismatches occur more
rarely but usually indicate more serious bugs where a wrong result is likely
(at least for some target-platform and optimization combination).
</p>

<p>
If short-term fixing of those issues is not feasible, the compiler flag
<code>-fallow-argument-mismatch</code> (implied by <code>-std=legacy</code>)
downgrades the error to a warning.
</p>

<p>
Example: Assume a subroutine which takes an assumed-size or explicit-size array
and the array size as another argument, such as
</p>

<pre><code>
      subroutine sub_assumed(array, n)
        real array(*)
        integer n
        …
      end

      subroutine another_explicit(array, n)
        integer n
        real array(n)
        …
      end
</code></pre>

<p>
An invalid but comparably common use is to pass scalar to such procedures:
</p>

<pre><code>
      real var
      …
      call sub_assumed(var, 1)
</pre></code>

<p>
This can be fixed in several ways. The simplest and most localized one is the
following; the scalar is replaced by an array.  In the second subroutine, it
is assumed that the argument is both read from and written to. In the third
procedure, a single number is passed, which is assumed to be only accessed for
reading. (Note: By adding the brackets, a Fortran 66 or 77 compiler can no
longer compile it.)

<pre><code>
      subroutine caller()
        real var<span class="red">(1)</span>
        …
        call sub_assumed(var, 1)
      end

      subroutine caller_arg(var)
        real var
        real <span class="red">var2(1)</span>
        …
        <span class="red">var2(1)</span>var2(1) = var
        call sub_assumed(var<span class="red">2</span>, 1)
        <span class="red">var = var2(1)</span>
      end

      subroutine caller_readonly(var)
        …
<em>! Before: var = func(42.0, 1)</em>
        var = func(<span class="red">[</span>42.0<span class="red">]</span>, 1)
</code></pre>
