<h1>GCC 3.5 Release Series<br />Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>GCC now generates location lists by default when compiling with debug
	info and optimization.
	<ul>
	  <li>GDB 6.0 and older crashes when it sees location lists.
	      GDB 6.1 or later is needed to debug binaries containing location
	      lists.</li>
	  <li>When you are trying to view a value of a variable in a part of
	      a function where it has no location (for example when the variable
	      is no longer used and thus its location was used for something
	      else) GDB will say that it is not available.</li>
	</ul>
	You can disable generating location lists by
	<code>-fno-var-tracking</code>.</li>
    <li>GCC no longer accepts the <code>-fwritable-strings</code>
        option.  Use named character arrays when you need a writable
        string.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<h3>C and Objective-C</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The <code>-Wstrict-aliasing=2</code> option has been added.  This
        warning catches all unsafe cases, but it may also give a warning for
        some cases that are safe.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

<h3>H8/300</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The frame layout has changed.  In the new layout, the prologue
    of a function first saves registers and then allocate space for
    locals, resulting in an 1% improvement on code size.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Documentation improvements</h2>

<h2>Other significant improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Location lists are now generated by default when compiling with debug
	info and optimization.  Location lists provide more accurate debug info
	about locations of variables and they allow debugging code compiled
	with <code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code>.</li>
  </ul>
