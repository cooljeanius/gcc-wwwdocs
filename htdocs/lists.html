<p>The GCC project has many mailing lists:

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-announce/">gcc-announce</a></b>
  is a read-only low volume list where
  we post announcements about releases or other important events.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/">gcc</a></b>
  is a high volume list for general development discussions about gcc.
  Anything not
  covered by other mailing lists is suitable for discussion on <b>gcc</b>.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/">gcc-help</a></b>
  is a relatively high volume list for people searching for help in building
  gcc.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/">gcc-bugs</a></b>
  is a relatively high volume list for bug reports and general discussion
  about bugs in gcc.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/">gcc-patches</a></b>
  is a relatively high volume list for patch submissions and discussion of
  particular patches.  All patch submissions and all discussion for a
  particular patch should be sent to <b>gcc-patches</b>.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-cvs/">gcc-cvs</a></b>
  is a read-only, relatively high volume list which tracks checkins to the
  gcc CVS repository.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-cvs-wwwdocs/">gcc-cvs-wwwdocs</a></b>
  is a read-only, relatively low volume list which tracks checkins to
  the gcc webpages CVS repository.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/">
  gcc-testresults</a></b> is a moderate volume list where test results for
  the gcc compilers are posted.
</ul>

<p>To post a message, just send mail to <i>listname</i><tt>@gcc.gnu.org</tt>.


<h2><a name="msgsize">Policies</a></h2>

<p>All the lists have a maximum message size.  If your message exceeds
more than 100kbytes, you should compress any attachments before sending
it to the list.

<p>When posting messages, please select an appropriate list for the message
and try to avoid cross posting a message to several lists.

<p>Please refrain from sending messages in HTML, RTF or similiar formats.</p>


<h2>Archives</h2>

<p>Web archives for all mailing lists are on-line
(<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-announce/">gcc-announce</a>,
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/">gcc</a>,
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/">gcc-bugs</a>,
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/">gcc-help</a>,
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/">gcc-patches</a>,
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-cvs/">gcc-cvs</a>,
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-cvs-wwwdocs/">gcc-cvs-wwwdocs</a>, and
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/">gcc-testresults</a>),
plus you can also <a href="ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/gcc/mail-archives/">
download mbox formatted archives of each mailing list</a>.

<p>The web archives are <a href="#searchbox">searchable</a> for
messages from the beginning of 1999 and on.
A <a href="http://bitrange.com/gcc/search.html">backup search
engine</a> that includes 1997 and 1998, is currently hosted at
<a href="http://bitrange.com/">BitRange.com</a>. If you have
comments about the search function, please send a copy to
<a href="mailto:hp@bitrange.com">hp@bitrange.com</a>.


<h2>Subscribing/unsubscribing</h2>

<p>You will be able to subscribe or unsubscribe from any of the GCC mailing
lists via this form:

<blockquote>
<form method="get" action="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/ml-request">
  Mailing list: 
  <select name="listname">
   <option value="gcc-announce">gcc-announce
   <option value="gcc">gcc
   <option value="gcc-help">gcc-help
   <option value="gcc-bugs">gcc-bugs
   <option value="gcc-patches">gcc-patches
   <option value="gcc-cvs">gcc-cvs
   <option value="gcc-cvs-wwwdocs">gcc-cvs-wwwdocs
   <option value="gcc-testresults">gcc-testresults
  </select>
 <br>
  Your e-mail address:
  <input type="text" name="username" size="14">
 <br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="digest">Digest version
  <tt>&nbsp;</tt>
  <select name="operation">
    <option value="subscribe">subscribe
    <option value="unsubscribe">unsubscribe
  </select>
  <tt>&nbsp;</tt>
 <input type="Submit" name="submit" value="Process that!">
</form>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're having trouble getting off a list, look at the
<b><tt>List-Unsubscribe:</tt></b> header on a message sent to that list.
It has your subscribed address included in it.  Send mail to that address
(omit the <tt>mailto:</tt> part) and you'll be unsubscribing yourself from
that mailing list.  You'll need to confirm the unsubscription, of course.

<p>Please trust in the <tt>List-Unsubscribe:</tt> header.  Every person
who has said "I can't get off this list!  Unsubscribe me!" has found,
with enough prodding, that sending mail to the address listed in
<tt>List-Unsubscribe:</tt> does the trick.

<h2>Filtering</h2>

<p>If you want to use procmail or similar tools to process the GCC
mailing lists, you can filter using the Sender: header, as well as all
of the RFC2369 headers (List-Subscribe, List-Unsubscribe, List-Post,
List-Archive, etc.).</p>

<p>For example, the following procmail rule will sort all mail from
our lists into a single folder named INLIST.gcc:

<blockquote><code>
:0<br>
* ^Sender: gcc(-announce|-bugs|-patches)?-owner@gcc.gnu.org<br>
INLIST.gcc<br>
</code></blockquote>

<h2>Help</h2>

<p>For further information on using the lists, send a blank mail to
<code><i>listname</i>-help@gcc.gnu.org</code>.</p>

<h2>Spam blocking</h2>

<p>To reduce spam sent to the GCC mailing lists, a handful of Realtime
Blackhole Lists (RBLs) are consulted.  If you're sending mail from a
site that is listed in one of these RBLs, contact your site administrator
about fixing your mail setup.  Spammers are taking advantage of your
site to relay their spam.

<p>The following RBLs are consulted on all e-mail before it is distributed:
<a href="http://www.mail-abuse.org/rbl/">MAPS RBL</a>, 
<a href="http://www.mail-abuse.org/rss/">MAPS RSS</a>, 
<a href="http://www.orbs.org/">ORBS</a>, 
<a href="http://www.mail-abuse.org/dul/">MAPS DUL</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.imrss.org/dssl/">DSSL</a>.

<p>To complicate the harvesting of e-mail addresses from the web archives
of the GCC mailing lists, some simple transformations are done on the
e-mail addresses.  It isn't perfect, but short of destructively modifying
addresses or omitting addresses altogether, there isn't a whole lot we
can do right now.
