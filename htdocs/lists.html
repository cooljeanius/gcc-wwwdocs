<h1 align="center">egcs project mailing lists</h1>


<p>We have moved all mailing list functions from the Cygnus mailserver to the
egcs machine. If you have problems sending mail to egcs.cygnus.com, note that
we block spam sites and open mail relays by subscribing to
<a href="http://maps.vix.com/rbl/"> MAPS
RBL</a> and <a href="http://www.orbs.org/">ORBS</a>. Please do not
complain to us, but ask your server admin to fix his setup.

<p>The conversion to egcs.cygnus.com has three key benefits:
<ol>  
  <li> The delay between the time a message is posted to a
  list and the time it arrives at its final destination should be significantly
  reduced.
  <li> We will be able to put in anti-spam filters on our lists without
  affecting Cygnus's mailserver (see above).
  <li> More of the list functions will be automated.
</ol>

<p>Please read the subscribe/unsubscribe instructions carefully.  They 
may have changed since you last visited this page.

40kbytes, you should compress any attachments before sending it to the list.
