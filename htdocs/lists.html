<p><a name="gcc">The GCC project has many mailing lists</a>:

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-announce/">gcc-announce</a></b>
  is a read-only low volume list where
  we post announcements about releases or other important events.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/">gcc</a></b>
  is a high volume list for general development discussions about GCC.
  Anything not
  covered by other mailing lists is suitable for discussion here.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/">gcc-help</a></b>
  is a relatively high volume list for people searching for help in building
  GCC.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/">gcc-bugs</a></b>
  is a relatively high volume list for bug reports and general discussion
  about bugs in GCC.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/">gcc-patches</a></b>
  is a relatively high volume list for patch submissions and discussion of
  particular patches.  All patch submissions and all discussion for a
  particular patch should be sent to this list.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-testresults/">
  gcc-testresults</a></b> is a moderate volume list where test results for
  the GCC compilers are posted.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/">libstdc++</a></b>
  is the main discussion and development list for the standard C++
  library (libstdc++-v3).  Patches to libstdc++-v3 should be sent to
  both this list and <b>gcc-patches</b>.</li>

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java-announce/">java-announce</a></b>
  is a low-volume, moderated, announcements-only list.</li>

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java/">java</a></b>
  is the main discussion and development list for the Java language
  front end to gcc, and the corresponding runtime library.</li>

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java-patches/">java-patches</a></b>
  is a list for submission and discussion of patches to libgcj, the
  Java runtime.  Patches to gcj, the Java language front end, should
  go to <b>gcc-patches</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Read only lists:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-prs/">gcc-prs</a></b>
  is a read-only, relatively high volume list which tracks problem reports
  as they are entered into our GNATS database.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-cvs/">gcc-cvs</a></b>
  is a read-only, relatively high volume list which tracks checkins to the
  GCC CVS repository.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++-cvs/">libstdc++-cvs</a></b>
  is a read-only, relatively low volume list which tracks checkins to
  the libstdc++-v3 part of the GCC CVS repository.  This is a subset
  of the messages to <b>gcc-cvs</b>.</li>

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-cvs-wwwdocs/">gcc-cvs-wwwdocs</a></b>
  is a read-only, relatively low volume list which tracks checkins to
  the GCC webpages CVS repository.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-regression/">
  gcc-regression</a></b> is a read-only moderate volume list where regression
  results for the GCC compilers are posted.

  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java-prs/">java-prs</a></b>
  is a read-only list which tracks Java-related problem reports as
  they are entered into our GNATS database.</li>

  <li><b>java-cvs</b>
  tracks checkins to the Java language compiler and runtime.  It is
  not archived.</li>
</ul>

<p>Historical lists (archives only, no longer in use):</p>

<ul>
  <li><b><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++-prs/">libstdc++-prs</a></b>
  was formerly used for problem reports in the libstdc++-v3 GNATS
  database.  libstdc++-v3 now uses the GCC GNATS database and the
  <b>gcc-prs</b> list.</li>
</ul>

<p>To post a message, just send mail to <i>listname</i><tt>@gcc.gnu.org</tt>.

<h2><a name="msgsize">Policies</a></h2>

<p>All the lists have a maximum message size.  If your message exceeds
more than 100kbytes, you should compress any attachments before sending
it to the list.

<p>When posting messages, please select an appropriate list for the message
and try to avoid cross posting a message to several lists.

<p>Please refrain from sending messages in HTML, RTF or similar formats.</p>


<h2>Archives</h2>

<p>In addition to the web archives that are linked from the descriptions
above, we also provide
<a href="ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/mail-archives/">mbox formatted
archives of each mailing list</a>.  The <a
href="ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/libstdc++/mail-archives/">mbox formatted
archives of the libstdc++ mailing lists</a> are at present in a
separate directory.

<!-- The server-side included form does not show up at mirrors, so refer
     to it by an explicit hostname to avoid confusion.  -->
<p>The web archives are <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/lists.html#searchbox">searchable</a>.</p>


<h2>Subscribing/unsubscribing</h2>

<p>You will be able to subscribe or unsubscribe from any of the GCC mailing
lists via this form:

<blockquote>
<form method="get" action="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/ml-request">
  Mailing list: 
  <select name="listname">
   <option value="gcc-announce">gcc-announce
   <option value="gcc">gcc
   <option value="gcc-help">gcc-help
   <option value="gcc-bugs">gcc-bugs
   <option value="gcc-patches">gcc-patches
   <option value="gcc-testresults">gcc-testresults
   <option value="gcc-prs">gcc-prs
   <option value="gcc-cvs">gcc-cvs
   <option value="gcc-cvs-wwwdocs">gcc-cvs-wwwdocs
   <option value="gcc-regression">gcc-regression
   <option value="libstdc++">libstdc++
   <option value="libstdc++-cvs">libstdc++-cvs
   <option value="java-announce">java-announce
   <option value="java">java
   <option value="java-patches">java-patches
   <option value="java-prs">java-prs
   <option value="java-cvs">java-cvs
  </select>
 <br>
  Your e-mail address:
  <input type="text" name="username" size="14">
 <br>
  <input type="checkbox" name="digest">Digest version
  <tt>&nbsp;</tt>
  <select name="operation">
    <option value="subscribe">subscribe
    <option value="unsubscribe">unsubscribe
  </select>
  <tt>&nbsp;</tt>
 <input type="Submit" name="submit" value="Process that!">
</form>
</blockquote>

<p>If you're having trouble getting off a list, look at the
<b><tt>List-Unsubscribe:</tt></b> header on a message sent to that list.
It has your subscribed address included in it.  Send mail to that address
(omit the <tt>mailto:</tt> part) and you'll be unsubscribing yourself from
that mailing list.  You'll need to confirm the unsubscription, of course.

<p>Please trust in the <tt>List-Unsubscribe:</tt> header.  Every person
who has said "I can't get off this list!  Unsubscribe me!" has found,
with enough prodding, that sending mail to the address listed in
<tt>List-Unsubscribe:</tt> does the trick.

<h2>Filtering</h2>

<p>If you want to use procmail or similar tools to process the GCC
mailing lists, you can filter using the Sender: header, as well as all
of the RFC2369 headers (List-Subscribe, List-Unsubscribe, List-Post,
List-Archive, etc.).</p>

<p>For example, the following procmail rule will sort all mail from
our lists into a single folder named INLIST.gcc:</p>

<blockquote><code>
:0<br>
* ^Sender: .*-owner@gcc.gnu.org<br>
INLIST.gcc<br>
</code></blockquote>

<p>To filter duplicate messages due to cross-posts to multiple lists, you
can use the following recipe (Use at your own risk!):</p>

<blockquote><code>
:0 Wh: msgid.lock<br>
* ^Sender: .*-owner@gcc.gnu.org<br>
| formail -D 8192 msgid.cache
</code></blockquote>

<h2>Help</h2>

<p>For further information on using the lists, send a blank mail to
<code><i>listname</i>-help@gcc.gnu.org</code>.</p>

<h2>Spam blocking</h2>

<p>To reduce spam sent to the GCC mailing lists, a handful of Realtime
Blackhole Lists (RBLs) are consulted.  If you're sending mail from a
site that is listed in one of these RBLs, contact your site administrator
about fixing your mail setup.  Spammers are taking advantage of your
site to relay their spam.

<p>The following RBLs are consulted on all e-mail before it is distributed:
<a href="http://www.mail-abuse.org/rbl/">MAPS RBL</a>, 
<a href="http://www.mail-abuse.org/rss/">MAPS RSS</a>, 
<a href="http://www.orbs.org/">ORBS</a>, 
<a href="http://www.mail-abuse.org/dul/">MAPS DUL</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.imrss.org/dssl/">DSSL</a>.

<p>To complicate the harvesting of e-mail addresses from the web archives
of the GCC mailing lists, some simple transformations are done on the
e-mail addresses.  It isn't perfect, but short of destructively modifying
addresses or omitting addresses altogether, there isn't a whole lot we
can do right now.
