<h1 align="center">egcs project mailing lists</h1>


<p>The egcs project has several mailing lists which may be of interest
to users and developers.  All the lists are under majordomo control 
with an open subscription and post policy.

<ul>
  <li><b>egcs-announce</b> is a read-only low volume list where
  we post announcements about releases or other important events.
  <li><b>egcs</b> is a high volume list for general discussions about egcs.
  Anything not covered by other mailing lists is suitable for discussion
  on <b>egcs</b>.
  <li><b>egcs-bugs</b> is a relatively high volume list for bug reports and
  general discussion about bugs in egcs.
  <li><b>egcs-patches</b> is a relatively high volume list for patch
  submissions and discussion of particular patches.  All patch submissions
  and all discussion for a particular patch should be sent to
  <b>egcs-patches</b>
  <li><b>egcs-cvs</b> is read-only, relatively high volume list which tracks
  checkins to the egcs CVS repository.
</ul>
  
<p>To post a message, just send mail to <i>listname</i><tt>@cygnus.com</tt>.

<p>When posting messages, please select an appropriate list for the message
and try to avoid cross posting a message to several lists.

<p>All the lists have a 40 kilobyte maximum message size.  If your message
is more than 40kbytes, you might try compressing any attachments.  If it
is still more than 40kbytes, then you should put the attachments on a
web or ftp server somewhere and note the location of the attachment in
your message.

<p>To subscribe to a list, send mail to
<i>listname</i><tt>-request@cygnus.com<tt> with a message body consisting of

<blockquote>
  <tt>subscribe </tt> <i>listname</i> <i>your-email-address</i>
</blockquote>

<p>To unsubscribe, send a mail note to the appropriate
<tt>-request@cygnus.com</tt> address with a message body of
<tt>unsubscribe </tt> <i>listname</i> <i>your-email-address</i>.

<p>Web archives for all three mailing lists are on-line;
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs/">egcs</a>,
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-announce/">egcs-announce</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-bugs/">egcs-bugs</a>,
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-cvs/">egcs-cvs</a>,
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-patches/">egcs-patches</a>.

<p>Unfortunately the web archives are not searchable.  We hope to replace
Hypermail with another archiving engine with search capabilities in the
future.
