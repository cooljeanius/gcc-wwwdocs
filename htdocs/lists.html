<h1 align="center">egcs project mailing lists</h1>


<p>We are in the process of moving all mailing list functions from the Cygnus
mailserver to the egcs machine.

<p>This conversion has three key benefits for the
egcs project.
<ol>  
  <li> The delay between the time a message is posted to a
  list and the time it arrives at its final destination should be significantly
  reduced.
  <li> We will be able to put in anti-spam filters on our lists without
  effecting Cygnus's mailserver.
  <li> More of the list functions will be automated.
</ol>

<p>Please read the subscribe/unsubscribe instructions carefully.  They may
have changed since you last visited this page.  They may also be different
for certain lists as we move the lists to the egcs machine.


<ul>
  <li><b><a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-announce/">egcs-announce</a></b>
  is a read-only low volume list where
  we post announcements about releases or other important events.

  <li><b><a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs/">egcs</a></b>
  is a high volume list for general discussions about egcs.  Anything not
  covered by other mailing lists is suitable for discussion on <b>egcs</b>.

  <li><b><a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-bugs/">egcs-bugs</a></b>
  is a relatively high volume list for bug reports and general discussion
  about bugs in egcs.

  <li><b><a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-patches/">egcs-patches</a></b>
  is a relatively high volume list for patch submissions and discussion of
  particular patches.  All patch submissions and all discussion for a
  particular patch should be sent to <b>egcs-patches</b>.

  <li><b><a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-cvs/">egcs-cvs</a></b>
  is a read-only, relatively high volume list which tracks checkins to the
  egcs CVS repository.

  <li><b><a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-testresults/">
  egcs-testresults</a></b> is a moderate volume list where test results for
  the egcs compilers are posted.  Note, there are no list archives for this
  list (yet).
</ul>
 
<a name="msgsize"></a>
<p>All the lists have a maximum message size.  If your message exceeds more than
40kbytes, you should compress any attachments before sending it to the list.

<p>When posting messages, please select an appropriate list for the message
and try to avoid cross posting a message to several lists.

<p>Web archives for all mailing lists are on-line;
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs/">egcs</a>,
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-announce/">egcs-announce</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-bugs/">egcs-bugs</a>,
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-cvs/">egcs-cvs</a>,
<a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ml/egcs-patches/">egcs-patches</a>.

<p>Unfortunately the web archives are not searchable.  We hope to replace
Hypermail with another archiving engine with search capabilities in the
future.

<h2> egcs, egcs-cvs, egcs-testresults and egcs-announce</h2>
<p>These lists are run from the new list server on egcs.cygnus.com and thus
work a little differently than the other lists.

<p>To post a message, just send mail to <i>listname</i><tt>@egcs.cygnus.com</tt>.
Please refrain from sending messages in HTML, RTF or similiar formats.


<p>To subscribe to a list, send mail to
<i>listname</i><tt>-subscribe@egcs.cygnus.com</tt> No message body is required.

<p>To unsubscribe, send a mail note to 
<i>listname</i><tt>-unsubscribe@cygnus.com</tt> No message body is required.

<h2> egcs-bugs, egcs-patches</h2>
<p>To post a message, just send mail to <i>listname</i><tt>@cygnus.com</tt>.
Please refrain from sending messages in HTML, RTF or similiar formats.

<p>To subscribe to a list, send mail to
<i>listname</i><tt>-request@cygnus.com</tt> with a message body consisting of
<blockquote>
  <tt>subscribe</tt> <i>listname</i> <i>your-email-address</i>
</blockquote>

<p>To unsubscribe, send a mail note to the appropriate
<tt>-request@cygnus.com</tt> address with a message body of
<blockquote>
  <tt>unsubscribe </tt> <i>listname</i> <i>your-email-address</i>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently messages posted to the lists get delivered to list members 24
to 48 hours after submission to the list.  As a result it may take a 24-48
hours after you subscribe before messages begin to flow, similarly it may
take 24-48 after you unsubscribe before the messages stop.
