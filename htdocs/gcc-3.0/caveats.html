<h1 align="center">GCC 3.0 Caveats</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Enumerations are now properly promoted to <code>int</code> in
  function parameters and function returns.  Normally this change is
  not visible, but when using <code>-fshort-enums</code> this is an
  ABI change.</li>

  <li>The undocumented extension that allowed C programs to have a
  label at the end of a compound statement has been deprecated and may
  be removed in a future version.  Programs that now generate a
  warning about this may be fixed by adding a null statement (a single
  semicolon) after the label.</li>

  <li>The poorly documented extension that allowed string constants in
  C, C++ and Objective C to contain unescaped newlines has been
  deprecated and may be removed in a future version.  Programs using
  this extension may be fixed in several ways: the bare newline may be
  replaced by <code>\n</code>, or preceded by <code>\n\</code>, or
  string concatenation may be used with the bare newline preceded by
  <code>\n"</code> and <code>"</code> placed at the start of the next
  line.</li>

  <li>The Chill compiler is not included in GCC 3.0, because of the
  lack of a volunteer to convert it to use garbage collection.</li>

  <li>Certain non-standard iostream methods from earlier versions of
  libstdc++ are not included in libstdc++ v3, i.e.  filebuf::attach,
  ostream::form, and istream::gets. Here are workaround hints for:
  <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/21_strings/howto.html">ostream::form</a>,
  <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/ext/howto.html">filebuf::attach</a>.</li>

  <li>The new C++ ABI is not yet fully supported by current (as of
  2001-07-01) releases and development versions of GDB, or any earlier
  versions.  There is a problem setting breakpoints by line number, and
  other related issues that have been fixed in GCC 3.0 but not yet handled
  in GDB:
