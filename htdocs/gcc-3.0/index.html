<h1 align="center">GCC 3.0.2</h1>

<p>October 25, 2001</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a> and the GCC
developers are pleased to announce the release of GCC 3.0.2,
which is a bug-fix release following GCC 3.0.1 released on August 20,
2001, and GCC 3.0 released on June 18, 2001.
</p>

<p>GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
GNU Compiler Collection.</p>

<p>GCC 3.0.x has several new optimizations, new targets, new languages
and many other new features, relative to GCC 2.95.x.  See the <a
href="features.html">new features</a> page for a more complete
list.</p>

<p>A list of <a href="buildstat.html">successful builds</a> is updated
as new information becomes available.</p>

<p>The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that
have contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc to GCC.  This
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/thanks.html">amazing group of volunteers</a>
is what makes GCC successful.</p>

<p>And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using GCC 3.0.x.</p>
