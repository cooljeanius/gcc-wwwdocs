<h1 align="center">GCC 3.0 New Features</h1>

<ul>
  <li>General Optimizer Improvements:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../news/reorder.html">Basic block reordering
        pass</a>.</li>
    <li>New if-conversion pass with support for conditional
        (predicated) execution.</li>
    <li>New tail call and sibling call elimination optimizations.</li>
    <li>New (experimental) <a href="../news/ssa.html">static single
        assignment</a> (SSA) representation support.</li>
    <li><a href="../news/null.html">Global null pointer test
        elimination</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="../news/unify.html">Global code
        hoisting/unification</a>.</li>
    <li>More builtins and optimizations for stdio.h, string.h and old
        BSD functions, as well as for ISO C99 functions.</li> 
    <li>New builtin __builtin_expect for giving hints to the branch
        predictor.</li> 
  </ul></li>
  <li>New Languages and Language specific improvements:
  <ul>
    <li>Java support.</li>
    <!-- See also gcc/cp/NEWS; include a copy of the relevant parts as
         c++features.html.  -->
    <li>New C++ ABI, capable of inter-operating with other IA-64 compilers.</li>
    <li>The new ABI also significantly reduces the size of symbol and debug
        information.</li>
    <li>New C++ support library and many C++ bug fixes, vastly improving our
        conformance to the ISO C++ standard.</li>
    <li>New <a href="../news/inlining.html">inliner for C++</a>.</li>
    <li>Rewritten C preprocessor, integrated into the C, C++ and
        Objective C compilers, with very many improvements including
        ISO C99 support and <a
        href="../news/dependencies.html">improvements to dependency
        generation</a>.</li>
    <li>Support for more <a href="c99status.html">ISO C99 features</a>.</li>
    <li>Fortran improvements are listed in
        <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/g77_news.html">the Fortran
        documentation</a>.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>New Targets and Target Specific Improvements:
  <ul>
    <li>New x86 back-end, generating much improved code.</li>
    <li>Support for a generic i386-elf target contributed.</li>
    <li>New option to emit x86 assembly code using Intel style syntax
        (<code>-mintel-syntax</code>).</li>
    <li>HPUX 11 support contributed.</li>
    <li>Improved PowerPC code generation, including scheduled
        prologue and epilogue.</li>
    <li>Port of gcc to Intel's IA-64 processor contributed.</li>
    <li>Port of gcc to Motorola's MCore 210 and 340 contributed.</li>
    <li>New unified back-end for Arm, Thumb and StrongArm contributed.</li>
    <li>Port of gcc to Intel's XScale processor contributed.</li>
    <li>Port of gcc to Atmel's AVR microcontrollers contributed.</li>
    <li>Port of gcc to Mitsubishi's D30V processor contributed.</li>
    <li>Port of gcc to Matsushita's AM33 processor (a member
        of the MN10300 processor family) contributed.</li>
    <li>Port of gcc to Fujitsu's FR30 processor contributed.</li>
    <li>Port of gcc to Motorola's 68HC11 and 68HC12 processors
        contributed.</li>
    <li>Port of gcc to Sun's picoJava processor core contributed.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Other significant improvements:
  <ul>
    <li>Garbage collection used internally by the compiler for most memory
        allocation instead of obstacks.</li>
    <li>Lengauer and Tarjan algorithm used for computing dominators in
        the CFG.  This algorithm can be significantly faster and more
        space efficient than our older algorithm.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Plus a great many bugfixes and almost all the <a
  href="../gcc-2.95/features.html">features found in GCC 2.95</a>.</li>
</ul>
