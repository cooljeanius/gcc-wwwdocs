<h1 align="center">GCC 3.0</h1>

<p>June 18, 2001</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a> and the GCC
developers are pleased to announce the release of GCC version 3.0.</p>

<p>GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
GNU Compiler Collection.</p>

<p>GCC 3.0 has several new optimizations, new targets, new languages
and many other new features.  See the <a href="features.html">new
features</a> page for a more complete list.</p>

<p>The GCC developers would like to thank the numerous people that
have contributed new features, test results, bugfixes, etc to GCC.  This
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/thanks.html">amazing group of volunteers</a>
is what makes GCC successful.</p>

<p>And finally, we can't in good conscience fail to mention some
<a href="caveats.html">caveats</a> to using GCC 3.0.</p>

<p>For additional information about GCC please refer to the
<a href="../index.html">GCC project web site</a> or contact the
<a href="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">GCC development mailing list</a>.</p>
