<h1 align="center">GCC 3.0 Release Criteria</h1>

<p>This page provides the release criteria for GCC 3.0.  GCC 3.0 will
not be released until these criteria have been met.  This page
enumerates the release criteria and provides a rationale for some of
the choices made in determining these criteria.</p>

<p>In all cases, these criteria represent the minimum functionality
required in order to make the release.  If this level of minimum
functionality is not provided by a release candidate, then that
candidate will not become the eventual release.  However, a release
candidate that does meet these criteria may not necessarily become the
official release; there may be other unforseen issues that prevent
release.  For example, if support for the Intel Pentium II is required
by the release criteria, it is nevertheless unlikely that GCC 3.0
would be released even though it did not support the Intel
Pentium.</p>

<p>Because the development of GCC is largely dependent on volunteers,
the Steering Committee may eventually have to decide whether to make a
release, even if the criteria here are not met.  For example, if no
volunteer can be found to verify correct operation of a particular
application program on a particular system, then that criterion may be
abandoned.  However, that eventuality should be avoided if at all
possible.</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>

<p>GCC 3.0 will contain considerable improvements in functionality
relative to previous releases of GCC.  Each of these improvements must
be completed before GCC 3.0 is released:
<ul>
<li><p>C preprocessor</p>
    <p>GCC 3.0 will use a new implementation of the C preprocessor.
       The old preprocessor has been allowed to rot, so 
       the implementation of the new preprocessor must be completed.
       (Note that GCC 3.0 will still use a stand-alone, rather than an
       integrated, preprocessor.  However, the preprocessor will be
       based on <code>cpplib</code> rather than <code>cccp.c</code>.)
       <strong>Done and surpassed</strong>.  The integrated
       preprocessor was ready in time to be made the default.</p>
<li><p>C++ ABI</p>
    <p>In order to avoid changing the C++ ABI from release to release, 
       as GCC has done to date, there must be a stable ABI.</p>
<li><p>C++ Standard Library</p>
    <p>The standard library is a part of the ABI.  Changing the
       standard library interfaces is effectively a change in the
       ABI.  It is important that we provide a standards-conforming
       C++ standard library.</p>
<li><p>Java Standard Library</p>
    <p>The Java standard library should be present in the tree is
       required in order to avoid users having to download it
       separately.  <strong>Done</strong>.</p>
<li><p>GCC Support Library</p>
    <p>The <code>libgcc</code> library will be built in both static
       and shared library whenever <code>--enable-shared</code> is
       used to configure GCC.  As GCC 3.0 will contain other ABI 
       changes, now is as good a time as any to make this change.
       <strong>Partly done</strong>.</p>
<li><p>Java Front-End Garbage Collection</p>
    <p>The Java front-end will be converted to use garbage collection,
       like the other GCC front-ends.  This conversion will enable the
       simplification, optimization, and removal of code in the
       machine-independent portions of the compiler, as well as in 
       the various back-ends.  <strong>Done</strong>.</p>
<li><p>Chill Front-End Garbage Collection</p>
    <p>Like the Java front-end, the Chill front-end will be converted
       to use garbage collection.  <strong>Dropped</strong>.  No
       volunteer has been found to do this, so GCC 3.0 will not
       support Chill unless one comes forward.</p>
<li><p>Open Bugs</p>
    <p>High-priority open bugs in GNATs will be fixed before the
       GCC 3.0 release.</p>
<li><p>Installation Documentation</p>
    <p>Merge on-line installation documentation,
       <code>gcc/install.texi</code>, past changes
       to <code>gcc/INSTALL</code> made in the CVS tree without
       realising that it was a generated file that were subsequently
       overridden when it was regenerated, the old system-specific
       <code>gcc/README.*</code> files, and
       <code>gcc/f/g77install.texi</code>.
       <strong>Partly done</strong></p>
</ul>

<h2>Platform Support</h2>

<p>GCC is available on a vast number of platforms.  However, it is not
possible to effectively test GCC in all possible configurations.
Therefore, a smaller number of platforms have been selected as
targets.  The targets chosen represent both the most popular operating
systems and the most popular microprocessors.  Of course, where
possible, the release will support other targets as well.</p>

<table align="center">
<caption>Primary Evaluation Platforms</caption>
<tr><th>Chip     <th>OS                  <th>Triplet
<tr><td>Alpha    <td>RedHat Linux 6.2    <td>

</table>

<p>GCC's performance on the following platforms will not be required
to meet all the criteria mentioned in this document before GCC 3.0
ships, but the performance on these systems will be of considerable
interest, and it is likely that serious problems on these platforms
will delay the release.</p>

<p>Among the secondary evaluation platforms, we are are especially
concerned about free systems (i.e., GNU/Linux and the BSDs) where GCC
also serves as the system compiler.</p>

<p>Volunteers will be required, both to test and to fix bugs, for all
secondary platforms.  (These volunteers may be the same person, but
volunteers should be careful not to sign up for more work than they can
actually do.)  If volunteers cannot be found for these platforms, then
the secondary platforms will be dropped from this list.</p>

<p>The bug-fixing volunteer will commit to ensuring that GCC 3.0 will
at least bootstrap itself on each of these secondary platforms.  That
commitment doesn't necessarily mean fixing bugs personally; for
example, if you are a manager for a company with GCC expertise you
could be the volunteer if you'll commit to donating your employee's
efforts as necessary.  The release manager, and the GCC development
team, will make reasonable efforts to assist these volunteers by
answering questions and reviewing patches as time permits.</p>

<h2>Language Support</h2>

<p>There are GCC front-ends for many different languages.  However, in
this release, only the behavior of front-ends for the following
languages will be considered part of the release criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>C
<li>C++
<li>Fortran
</ul>

<p>The following languages will be supported by the release, but their
behavior will not be a primary consideration in determining whether or
not to ship a particular release candidate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chill (<strong>Dropped</strong>; see above)
<li>Java
<li>Objective-C
</ul>

<p>In particular, no application testing, code quality, or compile-time
performance testing will be required for these languages.  However,
the regression testing criteria documented below will apply to these
languages, except Chill, for which no regression tests are
available.</p>

<h2>Regression Tests</h2>

<p>The GCC testsuite contains extensive C and C++ regression tests, as
well as some Fortran, and Objective-C tests.  GCC 3.0 will not fail
any of these tests which the previous release GCC passed on any of the
supported platforms.  In particular, the current regression testsuite
will be run using GCC 2.95.2 on each of the supported platforms; those
results can then be compared with the output from a release candidate.
Because there have often been issues with generating PIC code, we will
test with <code>-fPIC</code> as well.</p>

<p>In addition, on all supported platforms, there will be no
<code>--enable-checking</code> failures when running any of the
regression test-suites.</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>In addition to the regression-testing mentioned above, it is
important that operation of the compiler be verified on some real-world
applications.  The following applications represent a mix of low-level
and high-level code, of numerical and logical programs, and of
different programming languages.</p>

</table>

<p>These selections were made for a variety of reasons.  The Linux
kernel is one of the most important pieces of free software, and
kernel developers pay careful attention to GCC performance.  It would
be an embarrassment to GCC 3.0 if it did not compile the kernel
correctly, out of the box.  The kernel taxes many of the low-level
aspects of GCC, as well as many GCC extensions, including the extended
assembly syntax, addresses of labels, and so forth.  (Historically,
there have been kernel bugs, found only by more aggressive
optimization in new releases of GCC.  If such bugs are encountered,
then appropriate patches should be applied to the kernel before
testing.)</p>

<p>GNU Emacs is portable to almost every system available, and is a
complex application-level C program, known to have very few bugs.</p>

<p>POOMA is a complex expression-template library that will tax the
ability of G++ to deal with templates, an area that has historically
been buggy.  In addition, templates have historically taken
inordinately much time and memory at compile-time.  With the
widespread prevalence of templates in C++ programs, including the
standard library, testing this area heavily is vitally important.  For
instructions on how to set up and build POOMA and check the outcome
of its testing programs see <a href="pooma-guide.html"> this
guide</a>.</p>

<p>LAPACK is a well known linear algebra package that contains
code typical for large scale Fortran programs.
For instructions on how to set up and build LAPACK and check the
outcome of its testing programs see <a href="lapack-guide.html">
this guide</a>.</p>

<p>As progress is made towards the release, specific information about
how these programs should be compiled, and how their correct operation
should be verified will be made available here.  In general, however,
the purpose will not be to exhaustively test these applications;
instead, testers should simply verify that they compile, and perform
basic functionality correctly.</p>

<h2>Code Quality</h2>

<p>Historically, there has been no formal release criterion that took
into account performance of code generated by the compiler.  It is
important that the generated code performs approximately as well as
previous releases.  Therefore, we will use the following benchmarks
for measuring code quality:</p>

<table align="center">
<tr><th align=left>Name
    <th align=left>Language
    <th align=left>Source URL
<tr><td>gzip<td>C
    <td><a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gzip/gzip-1.2.4a.tar.gz">
        gzip-1.2.4a.tar.gz</a>
<tr><td>Stepanov<td>C++
    <td><a href="ftp://ftp.kai.com/pub/benchmarks/stepanov_v1p2.C">
         stepanov_v1p2.C</a>
<tr><td>LAPACK<td>Fortran
    <td><a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack.tgz">
        LAPACK 3.0 (timing programs)</a>
</table>

<p>A Java benchmark is not required for this release since there is
little precedent for the behavior of the Java compiler.  For Java,
functional completeness and correctness are still more important than
optimization.</p>

<p>In addition to the above benchmarks, the behavior of real programs
should be considered as well.  For that reason, the behavior of the
elliptic curve integer factorization program <a
href="ftp://ftp.loria.fr/pub/loria/eureca/tmp/GMP-ECM/ecm4c.c">ecm4c.c</a>,
which uses GNU mp, will be considered part of the release
criteria.</p>

<p>A release candidate will be deemed unacceptable if the performance
of the generated code is not at least as good as that of GCC 2.95.2 on
the benchmarks, and within at least 5% on the application tests.</p>

<h2>Compile-Time Performance</h2>

<p>There is a perception that development snapshots take longer to
compile programs than their 2.95.2 counterparts, and that they often
use more memory as well.  Compile-time performance is an important
part of compiler quality.  It is not enough simply to provide
additional optimizations; the compiler must also continue to compile
programs relatively quickly.  However, it is to be expected that
additional optimizations and additional features will have a non-zero
cost.</p>

<p>In order to measure compile-time performance, we will use the
following unit tests:</p>
<table>
<tr><th align=left>Name
    <th align=left>Language
    <th align=left>Source
    <th align=left>Flags
    <th align=left>Comments
<tr><td>insn-attrtab.c<td>C<td>
    <td>-O2
    <td>This file contains a large machine-generated switch
        statement; it is a reasonable benchmark for testing flow
        optimizations and for handling large functions.
<tr><td><td>C++
<tr><td><td>Fortran
</table>

<p>In addition to these unit tests, we will measure the time and peak
memory usage used when building the entire GNU Emacs distribution with
both GCC 2.95.2 and GCC 3.0.</p>

<p>If the release candidate's compile-time exceeds GCC 2.95.2 by more
than 15%, or if the peak memory usage exceeds that of GCC 2.95.2 by
more than 25%, that candidate will be deemed unacceptable.</p>

<h2>Open Issues</h2>

<p>The following issues are as of yet unresolved:</p>

<ul>
<li>What integration tests should be used for Fortran?
<li>What version of HPUX should we use as a primary platform?
<li>What other tests should we use for compile-time performance
measurement?
<li>What tests should we use for code quality?
<li>Should <code>-fstrict-aliasing</code> be enabled?
<li>Should we use flags higher than <code>-O2 -g</code> when
bootstrapping?  (Probably we should have a matrix of various flags, as
in previous releases.)
<li>Should we add PowerPC GNU/Linux to the list of platforms?
<li>Should we use Tru64 in place of Alpha GNU/Linux?
<li>Should we eliminate setjmp/longjmp exception-handling?
<li>Which open bugs need to be fixed?
</ul>
