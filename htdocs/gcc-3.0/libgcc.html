<h1>libgcc</h1>

<p>This page provides a summary of discussions about the pros and cons
of distributing <code>libgcc</code> as a shared library, as well as a
static library.  In addition this page details the plans regarding
<code>libgcc</code> for the GCC 3.0 release.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>Richard Henderson provided an excellent summary of the issues in <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2000-04/msg00610.html">a mail
message</a> posted to the GCC mailing lists.  For maximum convenience,
that message is paraphrased here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared objects must be linked against <code>libgcc</code>, just as
    main programs must be, in order to provide a variety of run-time
    support.
</li>

<li>If two shared objects (or one shared object and a main program)
    are linked against different versions of <code>libgcc</code> havoc
    may ensue.  In particular, entry points with the same name in
    different versions of <code>libgcc</code> may operate in different
    ways.
</li>

<li>To this end, a shared library version of <code>libgcc</code>
    should be persuaded.  All shared objects, and programs linked
    dynamically, should link against the shared version of
    <code>libgcc</code>.  That will ensure that only one version of
    <code>libgcc</code> is present in any given program.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, there are negative consequences as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The dynamic linker must be able to find <code>libgcc</code>.
       If <code>libgcc</code> is not installed in <code>/lib</code>,
       <code>/usr/lib</code>, or a similar automatically searched
       location, <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>, or its equivalent, will
       have to be explicitly set.</p>

    <p>(Note that this problem already exists with
       <code>libstdc++.so</code>, making <code>libgcc</code> a shared
       object is probably no worse for C++ programs than the existing
       situation.  Similar considerations apply to other
       language-specific run-time libraries; when created as shared
       libraries, such libraries must be made available to the dynamic
       linker.)</p>
</li>

<li><p>The usual concerns about shared library versioning apply.  A
       program linked against <code>libgcc.1.2.so</code> may not work
       with <code>libgcc.1.1.so</code>.  Therefore, shared library
       vendors may wish to distribute new versions of
       <code>libgcc</code> along with their shared libraries; users
       will have to decide whether or not to upgrade their
       <code>libgcc</code> when this occurs.  Even distributors of
       ordinary programs may be forced to distribute new versions of
       <code>libgcc</code> if the version of <code>libgcc</code> used
       when compiling the program is newer than the version of
       <code>libgcc</code> present on the target system.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>There is no real choice.  It must be possible for shared libraries
   built with different versions of <code>libgcc</code> to work
   together well.  Therefore, a shared version of
   <code>libgcc</code> will be distributed with GCC 3.0.</p>

<p>However, all possible efforts should be made to minimize user
   impact.  Therefore, system vendors should distribute
   <code>libgcc</code> as an easily upgradable package, just as they
   do with other libraries.  The GCC development team should avoid
   making changes to <code>libgcc</code> wherever possible, especially
   when such changes affect external interfaces.  And, at all costs,
   no changes should be made that remove functionality or entry points
   present in earlier versions of <code>libgcc</code>; doing so will
   require bumping the major version number on <code>libgcc</code> and
   will require shared library vendors to distribute new versions of
   their libraries.</p>

<p>A static version of <code>libgcc</code> will still be built, and
   should be used for statically linked programs.  (The static version
   might also be usable for programs whose only dynamic linkage is to
   shared libraries that do not link against <code>libgcc</code>, such 
   as the C library on a Solaris system, say.)</p>

<p>C library vendors should <em>not</em> make <code>libgcc</code> a
   part of the C library.  Doing so will mean that using a new version
   of GCC, which requires a newer version of <code>libgcc</code>,
   but linking against the same C library, would be impossible.  (Of
   course, if some kind of linker magic can be done so that the
   version of <code>libgcc</code> in the C library is disregarded in
   this case, then perhaps it would be reasonable to include
   <code>libgcc</code> in the C library.</p>

<p>The GNU C library project needs to be made aware of these
   conclusions, as they may need to take actions that facilitate this
   policy in new versions of the GNU C library.</p>
