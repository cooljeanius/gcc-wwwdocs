<p>GCC is distributed via CVS and FTP tarballs compressed with gzip or
bzip2. It is possible to download a full distribution or specific
components.</p>

<p>Please refer to our <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html">releases
web page</a> for information on how to obtain GCC.</p>

<p>The full distribution includes the C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java,
and Chill compilers.  The full distribution also includes runtime libraries
for C++, Objective-C and Fortran.  In the future the GNU compiler testsuites
will be included in the full distribution.</p>

<p>If you choose to download specific components, you must download the core
gcc distribution plus any language specific distributions you wish to
use.  The core distribution includes the C language front-end as well as the
shared componenets. Each language has a tarball which includes the language
front-end as well as the language runtime (when appropriate).</p>

<p>Unpack the core distribution as well as any language specific distributions
in the same directory.</p>
