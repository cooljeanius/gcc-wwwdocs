<h1 align="center">Installation Instructions: Testing GCC</h1>

<p><strong>Please note that this is only applicable to current development
versions of GCC and GCC 3.0 or latter. GCC 2.95.x does not come with a
testsuite.</strong></p>

<p>Before you install GCC, you might wish to run the testsuite. This
step is optional and may require you to download additional software.</p>

<p>First, you must have downloaded the testsuites; the full distribution
contains testsuites.  If you downloaded the "core" compiler plus any front
ends, then you do not have the testsuites.  You can download the testsuites
from the same site where you downloaded the core distribution and language
front ends.</p>

<p>Second, you must have a new version of dejagnu on your system; dejagnu-1.3
will not work.  We have made dejagnu snapshots available in
<a href="ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure">
gcc.gnu.org:/pub/gcc/infrastructure</a> until a new version of
dejagnu can be released.  If you find multiple snapshots of dejagnu
there, you should probably get the most recent one.
(Note, dejagnu will not build/run on NEXTSTEP systems.)</p>


<p>Assuming you've got the testsuites unpacked and have installed an
appropriate dejagnu, you can run the testsuite with `<code>cd
<i>objdir</i>; make -k check</code>`.
This may take a long time.  Go get some lunch.</p>

<p>The testing process will try to test as many components in the GCC
distribution as possible, including the C, C++ and Fortran compiler as
well as the C++ runtime libraries.</p>


<h2>How can I run the test suite on selected tests?</h2>

<p>As a first possibility to cut down the number of tests that are run it is
possible to use `<code>make check-gcc</code>` or `<code>make check-g++</code>`
in the gcc subdirectory of the object directory. To further cut down the
tests the following is possible:
<pre>
  make check-gcc RUNTESTFLAGS="execute.exp &lt;other options&gt;"
</pre>
This will run all gcc execute tests in the testsuite.
<pre>
  make check-g++ RUNTESTFLAGS="old-deja.exp=9805* &lt;other options&gt;"
</pre>
This will run the g++ "old-deja" tests in the testsuite where the filename mat
ches 9805*.

<p>The *.exp files are located in the testsuite directories of the GCC
source, the most important ones being compile.exp, execute.exp, dg.exp
and old-deja.exp. To get a list of the possible *.exp files, pipe the
output of `<code>make check</code>` into a file and look at the
"<code>Running ...  .exp</code>" lines.



<h2>How to interpret test results</h2>

<p>After the testsuite has run you'll find various *.sum and *.log
files in the testsuite subdirectories. The *.log files contain a
detailed log of the compiler invocations and the corresponding
results, the *.sum files summarize the results. This summaries list
all the tests that have been run with a corrsponding status code:</p>

<ul>
<li>PASS: the test passed as expected
<li>FAIL: the test unexpectedly failed
<li>XFAIL: the test failed as expected
<li>UNSUPPORTED: the test is not supported on this platform
<li>ERROR: the testsuite detected an error
<li>WARNING: the testsuite detected a possible problem
</ul>

<p> It is normal for some tests to report
unexpected failures.  At the current time our testing harness does not allow
fine grained control over whether or not a test is expected to fail.  We expect
to fix this problem in future releases.</p>


<h2>Submitting test results</h2>

<p>If you want to report the results to the GCC project, use the
<code>contrib/test_summary</code> shell script. Start it in the objdir with
<pre>
.../gcc-src/contrib/test_summary -p your_commentary.txt -m gcc-testresults@gcc.gnu.org |sh
</pre>

<p>This script uses the <code>Mail</code> program to send the results, so
make sure it is in your PATH. The file your_commentary_.txt is
prepended to the testsuite summary and should contain any special
remarks you have on your results or your build environment. Please
don't edit the testsuite result block or the subject line, as these
messages are automatically parsed and presented at the <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/testresults/">GCC testresults</a> web
page.  Here you can also gather information on how specific tests
behave on different platforms and compare them with your results. A
few failing testcases are possible even on released versions and you
should look here first if you think your results are unreasonable.</p>
