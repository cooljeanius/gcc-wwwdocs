<h1>Dealing with SPAM</h1>

<p>Occasionally some bozo decides to spam the GCC mailing lists.  While we
wish this would not happen, it is a fact of life on an open list (we do not
want to run a list where only members can post).</p>

<p>Some simple guidelines for how to deal with SPAM to the lists can help
avoid creating unnecessary traffic:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Never</em> respond to SPAM, no matter what the message says about
     "remove" instructions. It is <em>quite</em> likely that by responding
     you're simply sending the spammers more email addresses (such
     as yours) to use and share.</li>

  <li><p>If the SPAM you receive came through a list, remove that list
     itself should you decide to react after all, unless your email is
     really for list members to read.
     </p><p>
     That is, if *you* don't like SPAM, probably nobody else on the
     list does, and probably nobody wants to read how upset you are
     about the spam, because they're already just as annoyed.
     </p><p>
     Exceptions include email like this saying "people on this list
     should not respond to spam *on this list*".  ;-)</p></li>

  <li><p><em>Never</em> respond to SPAM.  Really.
     If you want to *discuss* things related to the SPAM, do not
     include spammers.
     </p><p>
     Otherwise, not only is your email address "harvested" as a
     future "we know there's a person behind this" address,
     anyone who absent-mindedly responds to your email without
     trimming the spammer's address also gets their address
     harvested.</p></li>
</ul>
