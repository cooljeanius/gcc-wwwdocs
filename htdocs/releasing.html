<h1 align="center">Rolling a GCC Release</h1>

<ol>
<li>Before rolling the release, update the release notes web pages and
ensure that they are all listed in <code>contrib/gennews</code>.</li>

<li>For a new major release, ensure that the build status page is
present.</li>

<li>Update the <code>releases.html</code> web page.</li>

<li>Update the version numbers of the current and future releases on
the main web page, and add a proper news item there as well.</li>

<li>Generate online documentation for the new release with
<code>update_web_docs</code> and link to it from
<code>onlinedocs/index.html</code> (but don't break URLs to
documentation for previous releases even if you remove the links to
it).</li>

<li>Add the release tag to the list in <code>cvs.html</code> (the
branch tag should already be there).</li>

<li>Update <code>~ftp/pub/gcc/README</code> and
<code>~ftp/pub/gcc/releases/index.html</code>.</li>

<li>Upload the release to <code>ftp.gnu.org</code>

<li>Announce the release the gcc-announce@gcc.gnu.org and gcc@gcc.gnu.org
mailing lists.
<ul>
<li>Make sure that most mirrors have retrieved the new release already.</li>
<li>In the case of a major release, coordinate announcements with the
FSF.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Increment the version numbers in the <code>[vV]version.c</code>
files and make them include the date and <code>(prerelease)</code>
instead of saying <code>(release)</code> and the old release version,
before allowing any new checkins to the branch.</li>
</ol>
