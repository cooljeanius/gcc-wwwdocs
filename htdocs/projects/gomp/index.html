<title>GOMP &mdash; An OpenMP implementation for GCC</title>
</head>

<body>

<h1>Welcome to the home of GOMP</h1>

<p>The GOMP project is developing an implementation of
<a href="http://www.openmp.org/drupal/">OpenMP</a>
for the C, C++, and <a href="../../fortran">Fortran
95</a> compilers in the <a href="../../">GNU
Compiler Collection</a>. As part of the <a
href="../../">GNU Project</a>, GOMP will 
simplify parallel programming for all GNU system variants. This
effort operates in an open environment to attract developers and
ensure applicability across multiple architectures and
applications.</p>

<p>Traditionally, programmers have used architecture-specific
methods to effectively program tightly-parallelized
computers &mdash; high band-width clusters, SMP machines, or
multi-core processors. Parallel programming has thus been a
time-consuming and arcane task.
</p>

<p>OpenMP offers a simple way of exploiting parallelism without
interfering with algorithm design; an OpenMP program compiles and
operates correctly in both parallel and serial execution
environments. Using OpenMP's directive-based parallelism also
simplifies the act of converting existing serial code to
efficient parallel code.</p>

<h2>Project goal</h2>
<p>To remain relevant, free software development tools must
support emerging technologies. By implementing OpenMP, GOMP will
provide a simplified syntax tools for creating software targeted
at parallel architectures. OpenMP's platform-neutral syntax
meshes well with the portability goals of GCC and other GNU
projects.</p>

<p>The GOMP release will include a support library, libgomp, and
extensions to target language parsers. The initial focus is on
implementing the basic syntax of GOMP in the C, C++, and Fortran
95 frontends, to be followed by specific implementations for
different platforms. A long-term goal is the generation of
efficient and small code for OpenMP applications.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>We encourage everyone to
<a href="../../contribute.html">contribute changes</a>
and help test GOMP.  GOMP is currently developed on a separate
GCC branch (<code>gomp-20050608-branch</code>, based on mainline),
and will be integrated into GCC after its efficacy is proven. We
provide read access to our development sources for everybody with
<a href="../../svn.html">anonymous SVN</a>.</p>

<h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>
<p>Bugs in GOMP should be reported via
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/">bugzilla</a>.  In all cases,
please add "openmp" to the keywords field in the bug report.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>November 18, 2005</b></dt>
<dd><p>The branch is ready to be merged into mainline.  All three
front ends are functional and there should not be many corners of the
standard left to implement.  There are 5 main modules to merge into
mainline: (1) runtime library, (2) code generation, (3) C front end,
(4) C++ front end, and, (5) Fortran front end.</p></dd>

<dt><b>October 20, 2005</b></dt>
<dd><p>The runtime library is functionally complete.  The syntax
parsers for C, C++ and Fortran are complete, though there are
still dusty corners with respect to semantic translation to be
resolved.  Adventurous users who don't mind the compiler crashing
on every other source file are encouraged to begin filing bugs.</p></dd>
