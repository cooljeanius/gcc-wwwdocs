<title>GOMP &mdash; An OpenMP implementation for GCC</title>

<h1>Welcome to the home of GOMP</h1>

<p>The GOMP project has developed an implementation of
<a href="https://www.openmp.org">OpenMP</a>
for the C, C++, and <a href="../../fortran/">Fortran</a>
compilers in the <a href="../../">GNU
Compiler Collection</a> and is further improving it. As part of the <a
href="../../">GNU Project</a>, GOMP
simplifies parallel programming for all GNU system variants. This
effort operates in an open environment to attract developers and
ensure applicability across multiple architectures and
applications.</p>

<p>Traditionally, programmers have used architecture-specific
methods to effectively program tightly-parallelized
computers &mdash; high band-width clusters, SMP machines, or
multi-core processors. Parallel programming has thus been a
time-consuming and arcane task.
</p>

<p>OpenMP offers a simple way of exploiting parallelism without
interfering with algorithm design; an OpenMP program compiles and
operates correctly in both parallel and serial execution
environments. Using OpenMP's directive-based parallelism also
simplifies the act of converting existing serial code to
efficient parallel code.</p>

<p>OpenMP additionally permits to offload computations on
accelerators such as <abbr title="Graphical Processing Units">GPUs</abbr>,
making use of their highly parallel computation support; if
no accelarator is available, as fallback, the computation is
then done on the host.</p>

<h2>Project goal</h2>
<p>To remain relevant, free software development tools must
support emerging technologies. By implementing OpenMP, GOMP
provides a simplified syntax tools for creating software targeted
at parallel architectures. OpenMP's platform-neutral syntax
meshes well with the portability goals of GCC and other GNU
projects.</p>

<p>The GOMP release includes a support library, libgomp, and
extensions to target language parsers.  A long-term goal is
the generation of efficient and small code for OpenMP applications.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>We encourage everyone to
<a href="../../contribute.html">contribute changes</a>
and help test GOMP.  GOMP has been merged into mainline GCC.</p>

<h2>Reporting Bugs</h2>
<p>Please add "openmp" to the keywords field when filing a bug report.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>libgomp, the GOMP support library, has
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libgomp/">online documentation</a>
available.</p>

<dd><p><a href="../../gcc-10/">GCC 10 has been released</a>; it adds a number of
newly implemented OpenMP 5.0 features on top of the GCC 9 release such as

mainline: (1) runtime library, (2) code generation, (3) C front end,
(4) C++ front end, and, (5) Fortran front end.</p></dd>

<dd><p>The runtime library is functionally complete.  The syntax
parsers for C, C++ and Fortran are complete, though there are
still dusty corners with respect to semantic translation to be
resolved.  Adventurous users who don't mind the compiler crashing
on every other source file are encouraged to begin filing bugs.</p></dd>
