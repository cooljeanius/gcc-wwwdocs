<h1>Abstract Syntax Tree Optimizations</h1>

<p>This page describes ongoing work to improve GCC's tree based
optimizations. There is a branch in CVS called,
<code>ast-optimizer-branch</code>, which is available to experiment with
these optimizers. As these stabilize, they can be submitted for review
onto the mainline development tree. Please contact <a
href="mailto:nathan@codesourcery.com">Nathan Sidwell,
&lt;nathan@codesourcery.com&gt;</a>, if you want to contribute.</p>

<h2>Background &amp; Rationale</h2>

<p>GCC, in common with many other compilers, has more than one internal
representation of a program. The main ones are trees and RTL. The
trees, (or formally abstract syntax trees - ASTs) are generated during
parsing, and are close to the source language semantics. The RTL is
generated in the back end, and is close to the generated assembly
code. Ideally, the AST would contain all the semantic information of
the source program.</p>

<p>Historically, GCC generated RTL one statement at a time, so
the AST did not stay around very long. This has changed with 'function
at a time' compilation (<a href="../news/inlining.html">Inliner</a>),
which both C and C++ front ends now implement. With the AST for complete
functions, and the additional semantic information they contain, the
opportunity for new optimizations presents itself.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>In addition to providing completely new optimization passes, there
are a number of sub goals.</p>

<h3>Provide a testing framework</h3>

<p>Although GCC's testsuite can verify an optimization's correctness,
there is no framework to verify the efficiency. Efficiency in both
compiler resources (memory and compile time), and produced executable
(object size and execution speed) both need to be measured. Without a
test framework, we will have no information about the effectiveness
and stability of optimizers.</p>

<h3>Optimization tuning parameters</h3>

<p>A number of optimizations can be tuned by various parameters. Giving
the user a knob to twiddle is good, provided (a) it does something (b)
there is a measurable way of determining its effectiveness.</p>

<h3>Move RTL optimizations to the AST level</h3>

<p>GCC has many optimizations that work at the RTL level. At the AST
level some of these can do a better job.</p>

<h3>Move AST optimizations into one place</h3>

<p>GCC has a number of AST optimizations that attempt to optimize trees
during parsing. These have limited effectiveness, and complicate the
parser. It would be better to put these all in one place, where they can
be more effective (by being repeated, or using common data).</p>

<h3>Move AST optimizers into the common middle end</h3>

<p>Although C and C++ both have function at a time mode, the AST new
inliner is only in the C++ front end.</p>

<h3>Provable optimizer performance</h3>

<p>It is often easy to implement a mis-optimization. Without evidence
that an optimizer actually does optimize, it will be hard to have it
accepted into the mainline. Obviously in the
<code>ast-optimizer-branch</code> branch, things are different.</p>


<h2>Status</h2>

<p>The branch was created from the development mainline on 21 July 2001.
Its version string is 'ast-optimizer-branch'.</p>

<h3>New inlining algorithm</h3>

<p>The first AST inliner was top down, and exhibits problematic
compiler time &amp; memory usage at -O3. This is particularly nasty for
heavily templated C++ code. A new bottom up inliner is available for
testing, which it is hoped will provide better -O3 performance.

thread</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ssa_for_trees">SSA for trees</h3>

<p>The tree SSA infrastructure is maintained by <a

&lt;dnovillo@redhat.com&gt;</a>.  Documentation and plans about this 
pass can be found in the <a href="tree-ssa/">tree SSA</a> page.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>Checkout the <code>ast-optimizer-branch</code> branch</p>

<pre>
cvs co -r ast-optimizer-branch gcc
</pre>

<p>then configure and build in the normal way.</p>

<p>Please post patches in the usual way to the gcc-patches list, marked
<code>[ast-optimizer-branch]</code>. As this is a branch, and not the
mainline, the usual maintainer rules do not apply. This branch is
maintained by <a href="mailto:nathan@codesourcery.com">Nathan Sidwell,
&lt;nathan@codesourcery.com&gt;</a>. Approval from the usual maintainer
will be needed when submitting patches from the branch onto the
mainline.</p>
