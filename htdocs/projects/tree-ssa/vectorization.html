    <h1>Auto-vectorization in GCC<br /></h1>

    <p>The goal of this project is to develop a loop vectorizer in
    GCC, based on the <a href="./">tree-ssa</a> framework. This
    work is taking place in the autovect-branch.</p>

    <h2><a name="using">Using the Vectorizer</a></h2>

    <p>Vectorization is enabled by the flag
    <code>-ftree-vectorize</code>. To allow vectorization on
    powerpc* platforms also use <code>-maltivec</code>. On i?86 and
    x86_64 platforms use <code>-msse/-msse2</code>. The vectorizer
    test cases demonstrate the currrent vectorization capabilities;
    these can be found under
    gcc/gcc/testsuite/gcc.dg/vect/. Information on which
    loops were or were not vectorized and why, can be obtained
    using the flag <code>-fdump-tree-vect-stats</code>. For
    example:</p>

<pre>
loop at vect.c:53: LOOP VECTORIZED.
loop at vect.c:60: LOOP VECTORIZED.
loop at vect.c:67: not vectorized: complicated access pattern.
loop at vect.c:75: LOOP VECTORIZED.
loop at vect.c:86: not vectorized: mixed data-types
loop at vect.c:95: not vectorized: dependence between data-refs a[i_282] and a[i_47]
vectorized 3 loops in function.

<pre>
while (*p != NULL) {
  *q++ = *p++;
}

that can be operated upon in parallel are not consecutive - they
are accessed with a stride &gt; 1 (in the example, the stride is
2):

currently only a single vector-size per target is supported; it can
accommodate vector-size/element-size elements (e.g, 4 ints, 8
shorts, 16 chars for a vector of size 16 bytes). A combination of
data-types of different sizes in the same loop requires special
handling which is not yet supported):
    
<pre>
short *sa, *sb, *sc;
int *ia, *ib, *ic;
for (i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {

    Implementation</a></h2>

    <p>The table below outlines the high level vectorization scheme
    along with a proposal for an implementation scheme, as
    follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>The first column ("vectorization driver") lists the
            tasks that the vectorizer must consist of. It briefly
            describes the expected functionality of each task.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>The second column ("basic-vectorizer") describes a
            proposal for a basic vectorizer that provides minimal
            support for each of these tasks, listing the
            restrictions that will be imposed by the basic
            vectorizer on candidate loops. Loops that are
            considered vectorizable by the basic-vectorizer are of
            the form: <tt>for(i=0; i&lt;N; i++) {a[i] = b[i] +
            c[i]; }.</tt> The "basic vectorizer" is implemented by
            Dorit Naishlos.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>The third column ("enhancements") lists possible
            directions for extending the capabilities of the basic
            vectorizer. Some of these enhancements are aimed at
            improving the quality of the vector code that is being
            generated. Other enhancements aim at broadening the
            range of computations that are amenable for
            vectorization. Other focus on improved robustness.
            Following the table is a complete and detailed list of
            these enhancements. Next to each item which is already
            being addressed, there should be the name of the
            relevant contact person.</p>

            <h3>Modeling the target machine vector capabilities to
            the <tt>tree</tt>-level.</h3>

            <p>Expose the required target specific information to
            the <tt>tree</tt> level. This includes providing a
            mapping from scalar operations to the corresponding
            vector support, which will answer the following
            questions:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Does vector support for this operation
                exist?</li>

                <li>At what cost?</li>

                <li>How to express the vector operation at the
                <tt>tree-</tt>level?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The general SIMD support in GCC already provides
            some initial support; For simple operations which can
            be expressed using existing (scalar)
            <tt>tree-codes</tt> (<tt>PLUS_EXPR, MULT_EXPR,</tt>
            etc.) the existing infra-structure can provide answers
            for questions 1 and 2 above, however, the
            <tt>tree-</tt>level currently does not have an idea
            about the cost that this transformation actually
            entails. A first basic implementation will support only
            simple operations that fall into the above category. As
            the capabilities of the vectorizer are extended, it
            will be required to inform the vectorizer of the
            advanced capabilities available in the architecture
            (for example, support for operations on complex
            numbers, reduction, etc.). Such operations cannot be
            expressed using existing tree-codes. Possible
            solutions: introduce new tree-codes (and corresponding
            optabs); introduce new builtins that are exposed to the
            compiler; use target hooks to handle these cases (the
            hook could return a call to a machine specific builtin
            function). Another related design question that needs
            to be addressed here is how much information to expose
            to the tree-level (is it sufficient to indicate that
            conditional vector addition is supported, or do we want
            the vectorizer to actually generate the required
            masking/predication/select operations depending on the
            target? similarly for alignment, multiplication of
            integers, etc.).</p>

            <h3>Enhance the Builtins Support</h3>

            <p>Currently the tree optimizers do not know the
            semantics of target specific builtin functions, so they
            do not attempt to optimize them (or to SSA the
            variables passed as arguments to these functions).
            Since the vectorizer will probably end up generating
            calls to target specific builtin functions, this
            situation needs to be improved, i.e. - the semantics of
            these builtins needs to somehow be exposed to the
            compiler.</p>

            <h3>Cost Model</h3>

            <p>There is an overhead associated with vectorization
            -- moving data in to/out of vector registers
            before/after the vectorized loop, aligning of data
            accesses, etc. It is required to incorporate a cost
            model into the machine description in order to allow
            the vectorizer to evaluate whether it is worth while to
            vectorize a given loop. One can also consider using run
            time tests to decide which version of the loop to
            execute (scalar or vectorized).</p>

            <h3>Induction Variable Analysis</h3>

            <p>Used by the vectorizer to detect loop bound, analyze
            access patterns and analyze data dependencies between
            array references. One option is that the dependence
            tests would be designed deal with array references that
            are expressed in terms of a linear function of the
            iteration counter (in this case, vectorization will
            also benefit from optimizations like induction variable
            substitution and replacement of auxiliary IVs with
            linear functions of the loop index). A dependence
            tester that is based on IVs represented in this form
            would analyze each subscript of each array reference,
            and apply the appropriate dependence test (SIV, ZIV,
            MIV etc., see <a href="#Dependence">dependence
            testing</a>). Alternatively, an induction variable
            evolution analyzer could provide a different
            implementation to the dependence tester. This is the
            solution that is currently used, based on the Induction
            Variable evolution analysis developed by Sebastian
            Pop.</p>

            <h3>Dependence Testing</h3>

            <p>Following the classic dependence-based approach for
            vectorization as described in <a href=
            "#kenedy-book">[1]</a>, apply dependence tests to pairs
            of array references in each loop nest, and analyze the
            resulting dependence graph. We will start from a
            dependence analyzer that relies on the array references
            being expressed in terms of a linear function of the
            loop index, apply the simplest dependence tests to all
            pairs of memory read/write and write/write, and
            gradually extend its capabilities. The scheme below
            follows the algorithm described in <a href=

            <h3>Access Pattern Analysis</h3>

            <p>The memory architecture usually allows only
            restricted accesses to data in memory; one of the
            restrictions is that the accessed data must be
            consecutive in memory. Any other accesses (strided for
            example) require to perform special permutation of the
            data in order to pack the data elements in the right
            order into a vector register. Support for different
            access patterns consists of the following stages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Classify the access pattern of each array
                reference.</li>

                <li>Trivially handle consecutive (unit stride)
                access patterns (a[i]).</li>

                <li>Handle strided access patterns (a[2*i]). The
                stride 2 access pattern appears in computations on
                complex numbers, where the real and imaginary parts
                are interleaved in the input/output array.</li>

                <li>Handle other types of access patterns?</li>

                <li>Support pointer arithmetic.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In order to facilitate a scheme that trivially
            replaces each operation with its equivalent SIMD
            instruction, a preprocessing pass may need to take
            place in order to convert the scalar operations into a
            proper (scalar) form. For example, the following code
            sequence is generated in order to represent the
            expression <tt>'a[2*i+1] = b[i]</tt>':</p>

            <ol>
                <li><tt>T.1 = i * 2;</tt></li>

                <li><tt>T.2 = T.1 + 1;</tt></li>

                <li><tt>a[T.2] = b[i];</tt></li>
            </ol>

            <p>These operations (1 and 2 in the example) determine
            the data permutation that will be performed, however,
            they do not need to be directly vectorized. It maybe
            required to mark such code to indicate that no vector
            code needs to be generated for it; instead, we may want
            to consider collapsing this code into the relevant
            array reference, similarly to forward substitution (but
            this would probably mean breaking the GIMPLE
            conventions?).</p>

            includes simple loads, stores and arithmetic operations
            that operate on the same data type. Some computations
            require extra code to be generated in order to
            vectorize. These include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>computations with mixed types; these require

            <a name="Alignment"></a>

            <h3>Alignment</h3>

            <p>The memory architecture usually allows only
            restricted accesses to data in memory. One of the
            restrictions is that data accesses need to be properly
            aligned on a certain boundary. Even if the architecture
            supports unaligned accesses, these are usually much
            more costly than aligned accesses. The work on
            alignment consists of several stages:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Compute the misalignment properties of each
                memory access.</li>

                <li>Handling of aligned memory accesses only (do
                not attempt to vectorize loops that contain
                unaligned accesses).</li>

                <li>If it is impossible to determine at compile
                time whether the memory access is aligned, <a href=
                "#versioning">create two versions of the loop and
                use a runtime test</a> to decide which version to
                execute: the original scalar version (if the data
                access is not aligned), or the vectorized version
                (if the access is aligned).</li>

                <li>Develop optimizations that increase the
                alignment of data accesses (static loop peeling,
                dynamic loop peeling, etc.).</li>

                <li>Vectorize unaligned accesses. There are
                different ways to do that, depending on whether the
                target supports unaligned accesses, and also
                depending on what we want to implement at the tree
                level, and what we want to leave for the RTL level
                to handle. For example, one could generate the
                required code to support a miss-aligned memory
                access (for miss-aligned loads, generate an
                additional load and the required merging code).
                Alternatively, the tree level could just generate a
                "VEC_UNALIGNED_LOAD" statement, that will be
                translated later in the RTL level into the
                appropriate RTL sequence that handles the unaligned
                load (in a target dependent way). This means
                however that optimizations that try to reduce the
                merging overhead cannot take place at the tree
                level, where it is probably easier to do than at
                the RTL level.</li>

            this functionality is in apple-ppc-branch. Peeling and

            <h3>Idiom Recognition</h3>

            <p>It is often the case that complicated computations
            can be reduced into a simpler, straight-line sequence
            of operations. These operations may not be directly
            supported in a scalar form, but are supported by the
            target in a vector form. Such cases include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reduction operations:

                    <ul>
                        <li>Detect different kinds of reduction
                        (summation, min/max, min/max with index,
                        etc.); once detected, these idioms may be
                        replaced with a virtual scalar operation
                        (to facilitate straight forward vector code
                        generation).</li>

                        <li>Vectorizing the reduction requires
                        generating epilog code after the loop.
                        First, generate a scalar code sequence to
                        compute the epilog. Later, try to make use
                        of target dependent mechanisms to compute
                        the epilog of the reduction more
                        efficiently.</li>

                following code sequence (taken from the SPECint
                benchmark gzip) the conditional expression can be
                collapsed into a "subtract and saturate" operation

            <h3>Conditional Execution</h3>

            <p>The general principle we are trying to follow is to
            keep the actual code transformation part of the
            vectorizer as simple as possible: a simple scan of
            straight-line code, and a one-to-one replacement of
            each scalar operation with the equivalent vector
            operation. To support this scheme in the presence of
            conditional execution, we'll need to flatten the loop
            body by collapsing if-then-else into a conditional
            (scalar) operation (something like transforming -
            '<tt>if (x) {c = PLUS (a,b)}</tt>' into
            '<tt>PLUS_COND(a,b,x)</tt>'. These will later be
            replaced with a conditional vector operation using
            whatever support is available on the target (masking,
            predication or select operation). Flattening the loop
            body this way will greatly simplify the vectorizer.
            Some of the issues to think about here: (a) how to
            represent these conditional operations, (b) to what
            extent does the tree vectorizer need to be aware of the
            specific target support that is available for
            conditional vector execution (mask/predicate/select),
            and (c) how to allow a simple way to reverse this
            transformation if the loop doesn't end up getting
            vectorized.</p>

                avoid having to undo transformations); also, many
                of the things that can take place at the RTL level
                maybe simpler to implement at the tree level.
                However, this would mean that a lot of machine
                dependent stuff will have to be done at the tree
                level.</li>
