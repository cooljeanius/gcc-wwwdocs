<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
CLI is a framework that defines a platform independent format for
executables and a run-time environment for the execution of applications.
The framework has been been standardized by the European Computer
Manufacturers Association
(<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm">ECMA-335</a>)
and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO/IEC 23271:2006).
CLI executables are encoded in the Common Intermediate Language (CIL),
a stack-based bytecode language.
CLI framework is designed to support several programming languages
with different abstraction levels, from object-oriented managed languages
to low-level languages with no managed execution at all.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to develop a GCC back-end that produces
CLI-compliant binaries.
The initial focus is on C language (more precisely, C99);
C++ is likely to be considered in the future, as well as any
other language for which there is an interest for a CLI back-end.
</p>
<p>
The implementation currently resides in the st/cli branch.</p>

<h2><a name="contributing">Contributing</a></h2>

<p>Check out <code>st/cli</code> branch following the instructions found in the
<a href="../svn.html">SVN documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Being this a branch, the usual maintainer rules do not apply.
The branch is being maintained by
<a href="mailto:roberto.costa@st.com">Roberto Costa</a>.
Checking-in into the branch is free, provided that the action was
coordinated with the branch maintainer
and that the usual contribution and testing rules are followed.
The branch is still in heavy development and check ins into the mainline
are not planned yet.
