<h1 align="center">Stree design notes</h1>
<p align="center"><font size="-1">

</font></p>

<p>The stree project is based on three fundamental premises. First:
for an important class of development tasks (roughly: GUI programs
written in a relatively simple subset of C++, compiled at <tt>-O0
-g</tt>), compilation time is dominated by the C++ front end. Second:
the performance of the C++ front end is dominated by memory allocation
and management. This includes memory allocation, initializing newly
allocated objects, and bookkeeping for garbage collection. Reducing
front end memory usage should thus improve front end
performance. Third: many programs consist of small source files that
include truly enormous header files. Such header files
include <tt>&lt;iostream&gt;</tt> (25,000 lines),
Apple's <tt>&lt;Carbon/Carbon.h&gt;</tt> (91,000 lines), and the X11
headers. Any given translation unit only uses a tiny fraction of the
declarations in one of these headers.</p>


<p>The goal of this project is to reduce the time and memory
required for handling unused declarations.</p>

<h2>Basic design principles</h2>

<p>The main idea of the stree project is to avoid generating decl
trees when possible. Instead the parser will generate a compact flat
representation for declarations, called an stree, and expand the stree
to a decl tree when necessary. Strees are not a substitute for
trees. The middle-end and back end will still understand trees, not
strees.</p>

<p>Some immediate implications of this basic idea:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Trees and strees will always coexist. This means that it is
     acceptable for the parser to generate strees only in simple and
     common cases, and to fall back to decl trees in more complicated
     cases. We can incrementally add cases where we are able to
     generate strees.</li>
 <li>Usually we generate strees only for declarations that are not
     also definitions. So, for example, we would generate an stree
     for <tt>void do_nothing();</tt> (which the middle end and back
     end don't necessarily have to know about), but we would generate
     a full tree for <tt>void >do_nothing() { }</tt> (which the
     middle end has to expand to RTL).</li>
 <li>For a declaration that is not a definition, there is a simple way
     to characterize whether or not the definition is "needed": some
     other declaration refers to it by name. For example: if a
     function <tt>xyzzy</tt> is declared but nobody ever defines it,
     takes its address, or calls a function with that name, then
     that declaration isn't needed, and generating a decl tree for
     it is wasted time and space.</li>
 <li>This definition of "needed" immediately leads to an
     implementation technique. References to a decl by name always
     go through a <tt>cxx_binding</tt>
     object. (See <tt>name_lookup.h</tt>). So we just need to
     make <tt>cxx_binding</tt> a little bit more complicated: when
     we ask a <tt>cxx_binding</tt> for the value of the binding, we
     check to see whether we have a tree or an stree. If the
     latter, we expand it into a tree and cache the expanded
     version.</li>
 <li>Given this definition of whether a declaration is "needed", we
     have to be careful about putting decls on global lists. This
     work will be useless if we end up expanding all decls
     anyway.</li>
 <li>Error checking must all be done in the initial parse phase, while
     generating the stree, and not as part of stree-to-tree
     expansion. Rationale: we always need error checking, but not
     all strees will be expanded. (There is also an
     implementation reason why we don't want to defer emission of
     diagnostics. Early diagnostics reduce the need for global
     state to be remembered for each stree: source code
     position, <tt>current_binding_level</tt>, <tt>current_class_ptr</tt>,
     etc.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>An example: enumerators</h2>

<p>Consider the front end data structure for a simple enumeration
declaration, <tt>enum foo { a, b };</tt>. We have two enumerators. For
each one we need to know its name, its type, the underlying integer
type used to represent it, and its value. At present we represent
enumerators with <tt>CONST_DECL</tt> nodes, so each enumerator takes
128 bytes for the <tt>tree_decl</tt> node, plus additional memory
for <tt>cp-tree.h</tt>'s version of <tt>lang_decl</tt>.</p>

<p>Each enumerator has an entry in the hash table, an identifier. Each
identifier has a pointer to a binding of type <tt>cxx_binding</tt>
(this is the bindings field in <tt>lang_identifier</tt>, defined in
<tt>name_lookup.h</tt>). The binding for <tt>foo</tt> itself points to
a <tt>tree_type</tt>, and the bindings for <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt>
point to <tt>CONST_DECL</tt> nodes. Each <tt>CONST_DECL</tt> node has
pointers to the name and to the <tt>ENUMERAL_TYPE</tt> node, and
additionally has a pointer to a node representing the enumerator's
value. In simple examples like this one each enumerator's value is
an <tt>INTEGER_CST</tt>, giving us another 36 bytes
each. (An <tt>INTEGER_CST</tt> node contains a <tt>tree_common</tt>
subobject, with all the generality that implies.)</p>


<p>We don't need 200 bytes to represent the fact that the
enumerator <tt>a</tt> has the value 0. First: as an stree it's
unnecessary to store a pointer to the name of this enumerator. The
stree will only be accessed via a <tt>cxx_binding</tt>, so any code
that accesses the stree already knows the name. Second: it isn't
necessary to use anything so large as an <tt>INTEGER_CST</tt> to
represent the value "0". Most of the information stored in
an <tt>INTEGER_CST</tt> (chain nodes, type pointers, etc.)  is
unnecessary, since we already know we're getting to the value through
an enumerator. We only need to store two pieces of information: the
enumeration that this enumerator is associated with, and its initial
value. This allows us to represent the enumerator in six bytes: a
one-byte code for the type of the stree (specifically:
the <tt>TREE_CODE</tt> of the tree that this stree corresponds to),
four bytes (a pointer or the equivalent) for the enumeration, and one
byte for the value. Note that this implies a variable-width encoding
for the integer values; some enumerations will require seven or more
bytes.</p>

<p>Our current implementation is limited to enumerations defined at
namespace scope. First, enumerations defined at class scope require
additional context information. Second, enumerators declared at class
scope might have values that depend on template parameters, meaning
that we can't necessarily represent the values as simple
integers. Neither is a serious problem. Because
a <tt>cxx_binding</tt>'s value can be either a tree or stree, we can
use strees for the common, simple cases, and default to trees
otherwise. Because strees are a variable-sized representation, we can
add additional values needed for building trees for the complex case
as needed without bloating the simpler cases.</p>


<h2>Some implementation details</h2>
<p>The stree data structure itself is defined
in <tt>stree.[ch]</tt>. Strees are tightly-packed, serialized
representations of simple declarations</p>


<p>Strees are stored on the gc heap, but not directly: instead, they
are stored in multi-page blocks of virtual memory
(&quot;chunks&quot;), where a single chunk may contain multiple
strees. Each stree is represented by an index; a separate table maps
each index to the appropriate chunk and position within that chunk. We
thus don't traffic in pointers to strees, but rather in integer
indices referencing a location in memory. Storing strees in this
manner avoids creating new objects and additional work for the garbage
collector, and simplifies precompiled headers by ensuring that the
chunks don't need to be placed at a specific address or when
reloaded&mdash;only the table pointers need to be
swizzled.</p>


<p>Clients
access stree data via an <i>iterator</i>: given an
stree with index <tt>s</tt>, the function <tt>get_s_tree_iter</tt> (declared in
<tt>stree.h</tt>) creates an iterator pointing to the beginning
of <tt>s</tt>. Other functions declared in <tt>stree.h</tt> access the
iterator to extract each serialized value in turn. This scheme allows
us to store data in the most compressed representation possible, and
in a way such that clients are insulated from the details of the
representation. For enumerators, for example, instead of using a
full <tt>INTEGER_CST</tt> for each value, we can use one or two bytes
in the (typical) case where the values are small.</p>

<p>Strees are created with <tt>build_s_tree</tt>, a varargs function
defined in <tt>stree.c</tt>. Its first argument is the stree code, and
its remaining arguments are the contents of that stree and tags to
identify their types. There is no function for creating an stree by
treating it as a "stream" to which values are written one at a time;
eventually there probably will need to be one. It won't be hard to add
it. </p>

<p>The files <tt>stree.h</tt> and <tt>stree.c</tt> are
language-independent, since, at bottom, strees are just a way of
packing bytes and integers into chunks. Creation and expansion of
strees are language dependent. The present implementation is focused
on C++.</p>

<p>We change <tt>cxx_binding::value</tt> from
type <tt>tree</tt> to type <tt>s_tree_i_or_tree</tt> (a tagged union), and we change
<tt>IDENTIFIER_VALUE</tt> so that it returns the tree value, expanding
the stree if necessary. A few changes are required in functions that
manipulate <tt>cxx_binding</tt> directly, but those changes are
largely mechanical and are localized
to <tt>cp/name_lookup.[ch]</tt>. </p>

<p>Strees are expanded by the <tt>s_tree_to_tree</tt> function,
defined in <tt>cp/decl.c</tt>. There are three points to notice about
it. First, as described above, it uses the stree iterator
interface. Second, the first byte of the stree is the stree
code; <tt>s_tree_to_tree</tt> uses that code to determine what kind of
tree to create. Third, at present <tt>s_tree_to_tree</tt> doesn't
handle any cases other than enumerators.</p>

<p>The major changes required to use strees for enumerators are
in <tt>build_enumerator</tt>. First, we need to separate parsing and
error checking from tree generation, deferring the latter until
later. Second, for simple cases we use <tt>build_s_tree</tt> to create
the stree and <tt>push_s_decl</tt> to enter the stree into the current
lexical scope. In principle <tt>push_s_decl</tt> would need to know
all of the same logic that <tt>pushdecl</tt> does; in practice we only
use <tt>push_s_decl</tt> for the simplest cases, deferring
to <tt>pushdecl</tt> (i.e. using trees instead of strees) for the more
complicated cases.</p>

<p>This design has the virtue that most of the C++ front end doesn't
have to know about strees: code that goes through bindings to get trees
looks exactly as before. It has the defect that, as presently written,
it requires code duplication. The code required to generate an
enumerator node is in both <tt>build_enumerator</tt>
and <tt>s_tree_to_tree</tt>. Additionally, <tt>s_tree_to_tree</tt>
is manageable only because at the moment it only handles a single
case. If this project succeeds, and we're handling many kinds of
strees, it would become a monstrosity. The right solution will
probably be to replace <tt>s_tree_to_tree</tt> with a wrapper function
that examines the stree code and dispatches to a function for the
appropriate code, and, for each code, to write an implementation
function that's shared between the tree and stree versions. Similarly,
we can probably achieve better code sharing between <tt>pushdecl</tt>
and <tt>push_s_decl</tt>.</p>


<h2>Debugging information</h2>

<p>At present the compiler will not generate debugging information for
unexpanded strees. This is potentially a serious issue. In principle,
there are two ways of dealing with this issue: either figure out a way
to generate debugging information without expanding strees, or else
decide that it's acceptable to omit debugging information for "unused"
declarations. (Note that by "unused" we mean declarations that are
irrelevant to the compilation of the code, rather than the weaker
definition of "never executed". As soon as a declaration's name is
seen elsewhere in the code, we create a decl tree node for the
name.)</p>

<p>We don't believe this will be a serious problem. Consider the
effect of missing debug information for unused
declarations:</p>

<ul>

<li>Unused variables: Only variable declarations are affected;
    variable definitions require code to be generated, and so will be
    expanded. If the definition occurs in another translation unit, we
    can get debug information from there. If the variable declaration
    is completely unused then we can't do anything with it from the
    debugger, for it has no memory associated with it.</li>

<li>Unused functions: ditto. Again, the existence of definition or a
    function call counts as a use, so we will get debug info even if
    the function is defined in another translation unit. There's
    nothing a user can do in the debugger with a function that's never
    called or defined anywhere in any translation unit.</li>

<li>Unused classes and structures: at best, an unused class or
    structure is uninteresting because no instances of the object
    could have been created. If the instances exist in another
    translation unit, the debugging information in that translation
    unit will be used by the debugger. The only case where the missing
    information may be desired is if a programmer wants to cast a
    pointer to an unused type and view the memory. </li>

<li>Unused enums: like structures and types, unused enums are
    uninteresting because no uses could exist if the enum were
    unused. Like types and structs, programmers may want to see the
    value of an unused enumerator. Without additional work, strees
    would not provide enough debugging information for a programmer to
    see all enumerator values. However, that additional work won't be
    difficult if we decide that it's important.</li>
</ul>

<p>More importantly, some gcc versions already remove unneeded
declarations from debug information. GCC 3.4 does not generate DWARF
debug info for function declarations, and does not generate debug info
for unused types unless <tt>-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types</tt> is
specified. Apple's gcc has stripped "unused" symbols out of STABS
debugging format for the last two and a half years. The debugger team
expected many bugs from users trying to examine unused declarations,
but have been surprised at how few bugs they've received. One of the
few complaints was from a user who had a "debug" version of a struct
that was used only for pretty-printing the real structure, and was
stripped out because it was never actually referenced.</p>


<h2>To do</h2>
<ul>

<li>Expand to other kinds of declarations: enumerations inside classes,
enumeration types, function declarations, and class declarations. We
suspect that our biggest performance win with Apple's source code will
occur if we can lazily create class declarations, because measurements
suggest that creation of implicit constructors for unused POD classes
appears to take significant time during our
compiles.</li>

<li>Refactor the stree creation and expansion code
in <tt>cp/decl.c</tt>to avoid code duplication. Or, to put it
differently: develop a general framework for separating the early
phase (parsing and error checking) from the later stages of tree
generation and transformation.</li>

<li>Separate out the checks
required for user declarations from those for compiler-generated declarations.</li>

<li>Get rid of the <tt>tree_or_stree</tt> struct. Instead just use
an ordinary union, and steal one of the unused bits in <tt>cxx_binding</tt>
to identify which member we want.</li>

<li>Eliminate remaining global scans of decls, to make sure that we
don't expand strees unnecessarily.</li>

</ul>
