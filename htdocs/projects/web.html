<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>Any help concerning open issues is highly welcome, as are
suggestions.  Suggestions accompanied by patches have a higher chance
of being implemented soon. ;-)</p>

<ul>
<li>Move extra pages corresponding to technical news items into a
    directory of their own. Add an index for these.</li>
<li>Improve navigation, with a consistent (short) menu on every page.</li>
</ul>
