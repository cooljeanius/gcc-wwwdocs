<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>Any help concerning open issues is highly welcome, as are
suggestions.  Suggestions accompanied by patches have a higher chance
of being implemented soon. ;-)</p>

<ul>
<li>Move extra pages corresponding to technical news items into a
    directory of their own. Add an index for these.
<li>Write down some information concerning the benchmark suite, for
    non-insiders. [Marc Lehmann]
<li>Write down some information concerning the testsuite.
    This might be combined with the previous item. [Marc Lehmann]
<li>Include manuals for the latest release in onlinedocs, as well as
    those for current development.</li>
<li>Arrange for the preprocessing (style.mhtml) to apply to the copy
    of the web pages on www.gnu.org as well as that on
    gcc.gnu.org.</li>
<li>Merge <a href="../libstdc++/links.html">libstdc++/links.html</a>
    into <a href="../readings.html">readings.html</a>, and <a
    href="../libstdc++/thanks.html">libstdc++/thanks.html</a> into
    contrib.texi.</li>
