<h1>GCC: Web Pages</h1>

<p><a href="../contribute.html#webchanges">Contributing changes</a>
to <a href="../about.html">our web pages</a> is simple.</p>

<p>As changes are checked in, the respective pages are preprocessed
via the script <code>wwwdocs/bin/preprocess</code> which in turn
uses a tool called MetaHTML.  Among others, this preprocessing
adds CSS style sheets, XML and HTML headers, and our standard
footer.  The MetaHTML style sheet is in
<code>wwwdocs/htdocs/style.mhtml</code>.</p>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>Any help concerning open issues is highly welcome, as are
suggestions.  Suggestions accompanied by patches have a higher chance
of being implemented soon. ;-)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move extra pages corresponding to technical news items into a
      directory of their own. Add an index for these.</li>

  <li>Improve navigation, with a consistent (short) menu on every page.</li>

  <li>Set up a system that automatically checks the mirrors list.

  <p>It should detect mirrors that have gone away, are persistently
  down, or are very out of date (the last being easy to do for those
  carrying snapshots, harder for those with releases only).</p>

  <p>DJ Delorie &lt;<a href="mailto:dj@redhat.com">dj@redhat.com</a>&gt;
  has some scripts to do this already.</p></li>
