<h1>GCC: Web Pages</h1>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>Any help concerning open issues is highly welcome, as are
suggestions.  Suggestions accompanied by patches have a higher chance
of being implemented soon. ;-)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move extra pages corresponding to technical news items into a
      directory of their own. Add an index for these.</li>

  <li>Improve navigation, with a consistent (short) menu on every page.</li>

  <li>Set up a system that automatically checks the mirrors list.

  <p>It should detect mirrors that have gone away, are persistently
  down, or are very out of date (the last being easy to do for those
  carrying snapshots, harder for those with releases only).</p>

  <p>DJ Delorie &lt;<a href="mailto:dj@redhat.com">dj@redhat.com</a>&gt;
  has some scripts to do this already.</p></li>
</ul>
