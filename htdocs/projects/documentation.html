<h1>Documentation projects</h1>

<p>This page lists projects for GCC's documentation.  Some of these
concern the internals documentation of GCC, and obviously require
intimate knowledge of GCC's internals.
The other projects are about work on the user documentation, and could
be taken on by anyone who has mastered US English and has basic
technical writing skills.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#frontend_middleend_interface">Fully document the interface
  of front ends to GCC</a></li>

  <li><a href="#internals_and_porting">Better documentation of how GCC
  works and how to port it</a></li>

  <li><a href="#RTL">Fully document the back-end intermediate language
  data structures</a></li>

  <li><a href="#improve_manual_index">Improve the indexing
  of the GCC manual</a></li>

  <li><a href="#external_documents">Roll information in external documents

  <li><a href="#user_level_documentation">Improve user and installation
  documentation.</a></li>

  <li><a href="#revisit_actual_bugs">Revisit the list of "Actual Bugs"
  listed in the manual</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Always, anytime, feel free to shout at anyone who sends in a patch
without including all relevant documentation changes.</p>

<p>It is also always appreciated if you read the whole manual and become
familiar with what is documented where, and what documentation appears
to be missing.  Report or fix any problems you see.</p>

<h2><a name="frontend_middleend_interface">Fully
document the interface of front ends to GCC</a></h2>

<p>Fully document the interface of front ends to GCC, that is, the
<code>tree</code>, <code>cgraph</code>, and <code>langhooks</code>
interfaces, and the various functions, data structures, etc., that
a front end must or may provide.</p>

<p>We've got quite a bit of this but it is scattered all over the
place.  It belongs in the official manual.  There is a <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Trees.html">C/C++ specific manual</a>,
which is incomplete, though.  The file
<code>gcc/LANGUAGES</code> contains incomplete and outdated information
about changes made in not so recent years to the <code>tree</code>
interface.  Several people have written partial manuals on implementing
new front ends.  Pointers to some of those can be found in our <a
href="../readings.html">readings list</a>.  With the advent of tree-ssa,
most of these manuals are obsolete.</p>


<h2><a name="internals_and_porting">Better documentation of how GCC
works and how to port it</a></h2>

<p>The porting manual describes what used to be the proper way to
write a GCC back end.  It is several years out of date.  Find all the
out-of-date advice for porters and replace it with correct advice.
Mark old, deprecated features as such.  Replace examples using old
targets with examples for newer targets.</p>

<p>Here is an outline proposed by Allan Adler.</p>

<h2><a name="RTL">Fully document the back-end intermediate
language data structures</a></h2>

<p>Document every RTX code and accessor macro, every insn name, every
<code>tm.h</code> macro and every target hook thoroughly.  (See <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2001-06/msg00507.html">this list of
undocumented tm.h macros</a>).</p>

<p>These may involve hunting down whoever added whichever thing it is
and torturing information out of them.</p>

<p>Work out the correct argument and return types for each tm.h
macro, and make the manual describe them with <code>@deftypefn</code>
and similar using C prototypes.  For those macros for which
performance is not important, change them to be functions, in the
<code>targetm</code> structure for target hooks.</p>


<h2><a name="improve_manual_index">Improve the indexing
of the GCC manual.</a></h2>

<p>All command-line options should be indexed, and there should be index
entries for the text of all error messages that might be confusing, if
there is a relevant part of the manual.  See a <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/2001-02/msg00384.html">message to
gcc-bugs</a> about this.</p>


<h2><a name="external_documents">Roll information in external documents
the official manual.</a></h2>

<p>Start with the <a href="../readings.html">readings list</a> and the
secondary Texinfo documents in the source tree, such as
<code>libstdc++-v3/docs/html/17_intro/porting.texi</code>.  Pick your
favorite FAQ from the lists and roll it into the manual.</p>


<h2><a name="user_level_documentation">Improve user and installation
documentation.</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Add information on relevant standards.  Document the exact semantics
  of all the extensions.  Also say what they're good for.  If they're
  useless, admit it.</li>

  <li>Improve support for building other manual formats.  For example,
  arrange for <code>make dvi</code> at top level to build DVI versions
  of all manuals.  Add a <code>make html</code> target to build HTML
  versions of manuals (using <code>makeinfo --html</code>).</li>

  <li>Consider adding targets to build PostScript and PDF versions of
  all manuals (<code>texinfo.tex</code> includes some support for PDF
  output).</li>

  <li>Make sure all Texinfo manuals are included and installed.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="revisit_actual_bugs">Revisit the list of "Actual Bugs"
in the manual</a></h2>

<p>Go through the list of "Actual Bugs" in
<code>gcc/doc/trouble.texi</code>.  Work out what they refer to, if
necessary by asking people who were involved in GCC development when
those bugs were documented.  If a bug is no longer present, remove it
from the list; if it is still present, file a bug report in the <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/">GCC bug tracking system</a> or
fix the bug yourself.</p>
