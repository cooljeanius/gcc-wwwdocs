<h1>Projects for the C front end</h1>

<p>The following are some ideas for C front-end projects to work on.</p>

<h2>More warnings</h2>
<p>Warn about statements that are undefined because the order of
evaluation of increment operators makes a big difference.  Here is an
example:</p>
<pre>
*foo++ = hack (*foo);
</pre>
<p><code>-Wsequence-point</code> does some of this, but not that
particular case.</p>

<h2>Changes to support C99 standard</h2>
<p>The new version of the C standard (ISO/IEC 9899:1999) requires a
number of library changes; these have to be provided by the C library,
and not by gcc.  In addition, there are also changes to the language
proper, and some compiler support is needed for the new library
features.  An <a href="../c99status.html">overview</a> of the C99
implementation status is available.</p>

<h2>Implement various builtin functions for ISO C99's 
<code>&lt;tgmath.h&gt;</code></h2> 
<p>Design and implement builtin functions that assist in implementing
the ISO C99 <code>&lt;tgmath.h&gt;</code> macros.  These builtins
could be along the general lines of the macros used in glibc 2.2 (for
example, the implementation of <code>&lt;tgmath.h&gt;</code> might use
<code>__builtin_tgmath_unary_real_only (value, log2f, log2,
log2l)</code> to implement the <code>log2</code> macro), but should be
designed so that, if the Annex G imaginary types are implemented in
GCC, glibc does not need to change again to allow for them.  This
means additional functions, beyond those corresponding to the macros
in glibc, are needed to handle the trigonometric functions which G.7
specifies have real or imaginary result type for imaginary arguments,
but which have complex result type for complex arguments.  The design
for these builtins should be discussed with the gcc and libc-alpha
lists.</p>

<h2>Format (<code>printf</code>, <code>scanf</code> and
<code>strftime</code>) checking</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Make re-entrant: eliminate global state used for <code>$</code>
  format checking.</li>

  <li><code>strftime</code>: warnings for use of <code>0</code>,
  <code>-</code> or <code>_</code> flags without width on formats where
  inappropriate.  Similar warnings where use of one format feature is
  useless unless another one is also used also apply for
  <code>printf</code> formats (<code>0</code> and <code>-</code> flags
  when no width is specified and so there is no padding) and for
  <code>strfmon</code> formats.</li>

  <li>Integer <code>printf</code> formats: warn for integer constant
  argument out of range of unpromoted type (including signed/unsigned
  where it doesn't fit in range).</li>

  <li>Fix detection of whether format strings are narrow or wide on
  targets where <code>wchar_t</code> is <code>char</code>.  This may
  require changes elsewhere in the compiler to mark string constants
  with this information.</li>

  <li>Include an option to warn for format extensions that have been
  obsoleted by standard C99 features.</li>

  <li>Meaning of "quad" and <code>%q</code>: anything more accurate than
  <code>long long</code>?  See messages <a
  href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/1999-02n/msg00164.html">1</a> and
  <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/2000-08/msg00272.html">2</a>
  about this to gcc-bugs.  (Note that <code>%q</code> is now largely
  obsolete given the new C99 formats and macros.)</li>

  <li>Wide string format support.  See a <a
  href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2000-12/msg00170.html">message
  soliciting views on the user interface to this</a> and send any views
  on this to the <code>gcc</code> mailing list.</li>

  <li>Clean up how <code>format.exp</code> handles
  <code>TORTURE_OPTIONS</code>, by making changes elsewhere in the test
  harness so that <code>TORTURE_OPTIONS</code> is initialized for each
  <code>dg-init</code> rather than just once and so needing saving and
  restoring.</li>

  <li>When a <code>format</code> or <code>format_arg</code> attribute is
  applied to a function with a non-prototype declaration, and the
  function is later redeclared with a prototype or defined, the
  attribute should be checked again to see if it makes sense given the
  argument types of the function.  Similarly, these checks should be
  made if the original attribute is on an old-style function
  definition.</li>

  <li>Implement more checks related to <code>__attribute__((__nonnull__))</code>,
  such as for functions such as <code>execle</code> that require
  <code>NULL</code>-terminated argument lists.</li>

  <li>Possible security warnings under <code>-Wformat-security</code>:

  <ul>
    <li>Warn for <code>sprintf</code> into fixed length buffer if the
    output can't be proved not to overrun.  Similarly for
    <code>scanf</code> <code>%s</code> and <code>%[...]</code> without
    width to fixed length buffer (or possibly to any buffer); or
    <code>%s</code>, <code>%[...]</code> and <code>%c</code> with width
    to too short a buffer, including <code>%lc</code>, <code>%ls</code>
    and <code>%l[...]</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  </li>

  <li>(Maybe eventually:) Extensible format checking: allow programs
  such as OS kernels and parts of GCC to tell GCC about additional
  format conversion characters recognised by their format
  functions.</li>

  <li><code>fopen</code>, <code>freopen</code>: warning for the
  incorrect format of the mode parameter, see <a 
  href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/2001-12/msg00649.html">PR
  c/5127</a>.  Some ideas for how to implement such a warning
  were discussed <a 
  href="https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/2001-12/msg00651.html">here</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
