<h1>Benchmarking GCC</h1>

<p> For evaluation of the code generated by GCC a number of benchmarks
are available.  Some people run these benchmarks on a regular basis
and therefore allow to monitor how GCC's optimizations evolve over
time and whether optimizations really make a difference on the tested
benchmarks.
</p>

<!--
<h2>The GCC Benchmark suite</h2>

<p>
GCC has its own
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/benchresults/">benchmark suite</a>
which contains a number of smaller tests together with sources and
results from these runs for different platforms.
</p>
-->

<h2>SPEC 95</h2>

<p>
Diego Novillo has set up a Pentium III system that runs daily SPEC
95 tests.  The results can be seen at <a
href="http://people.redhat.com/dnovillo/spec95/">http://people.redhat.com/dnovillo/spec95/</a>.
</p>

<h2>SPEC 2000</h2>

<p>
Similar to Diego's setup, Andreas Jaeger is running SPEC 2000 tests on
AMD Athlon systems.  For details check <a
href="http://www.suse.de/~aj/SPEC/">http://www.suse.de/~aj/SPEC/</a>.
</p>

<p>SPEC 2000 tests on a Pentium 4 system are available at <a href="http://people.redhat.com/dnovillo/spec2000/">http://people.redhat.com/dnovillo/spec2000/</a>.

<h2>Related benchmarks</h2>

<p>
Charles Leggett runs several benchmarks (Bench++, Haney, Stepanov, OOPACK)
comparing various versions of GCC and KAI KCC with several optimization
levels.  Results can be found at <a href="http://annwm.lbl.gov/bench/">
