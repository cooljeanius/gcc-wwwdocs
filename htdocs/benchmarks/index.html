<h1>Benchmarking GCC</h1>

<p>
For evaluation of the code generated by GCC a number of benchmarks are
available.  Some people run these benchmarks on a regular basis and
therefore allow to see how GCC's optimizations evolve over time and
whether optimizations really make a difference on these benchmarks.
</p>

<h2>The GCC Benchmark suite</h2>

GCC has also it's own 
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/benchresults/">Benchmark suites</a>
which contains a number of smaller tests together with sources and
results from these runs for different platforms.


<h2>SPEC 95</h2>

Diego Novillo has setup a Pentium III system that runs daily SPEC 95
tests.  The results can be seen on the page <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/~dnovillo/SPEC/">http://www.cygnus.com/~dnovillo/SPEC/</a>.

<h2>SPEC 2000</h2>

Similar to Diego's setup, Andreas Jaeger is running SPEC 2000 tests on
AMD Athlon systems.  For details check <a
