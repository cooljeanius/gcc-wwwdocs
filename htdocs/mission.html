<h1 align="center">EGCS Project Mission Statement</h1>

<p>
<p>EGCS is a free software project to further the development of the
GNU compilers using an open development environment.

<p>Short and simple as a mission statement should be.  Additional details
on the key concepts follow.

<ul>
  <li> Free Software Project
  <ul>
    <li> Compilers are available under the terms of the GPL.
    <li> Copyrights for the compilers are to be held by the FSF.
    <li> Other components (runtime libraries, testsuites, etc) will be
         available under various free licenses with copyrights being
         held by individual authors or the FSF.
  </ul>
  <li> Further Development of GNU Compilers
  <ul>
    <li> New languages
    <li> New optimizations
    <li> New targets
    <li> Improved runtime libraries
    <li> Various infrastructure improvements
  </ul>
  <li> Open Development Environment
  <ul>
    <li> Encourage cooperation and communication between developers
    <li> Work more closely with "consumers"
    <li> Code available to everyone at anytime, and development is open
         to anyone that wants to contribute.
    <ul>
      <li> Patches will be considered equally based on their
           technical merits
      <li> All individuals and companies are welcome to contribute as
           long as they accept the groundrules.
    </ul>
    <li> Open mailing lists
    <li> Developer friendly tools and procedures (ie cvs, multiple
         maintainers, etc)
    <li> Conflicts of interest exist for many egcs developers, the
         developers as well as the egcs steering committee will not
         allow those conflicts of interest to have an effect on the
         egcs project
 </ul>
</ul>
