<p>The egcs project is rapidly approaching its second major release
(egcs-1.1).

<p>This page is meant to provide information about the current schedule
for egcs-1.1, the testing/release criteria for egcs-1.1, new features
to be found in egcs-1.1, etc.

<p>The tenative schedule for the egcs-1.1 release is:

<ul>
  <li> <b>July 3, 1998. Feature freeze date</b>.
  <p>All new features, optimizations, etc need to be <i>submitted</i> by
  this date.  It is very likely that not all submissions will be accepted
  for egcs-1.1.  But all submissions need to be made available for evaluation
  by July 3, 1998.

  <p> It is also possible some patches which have been submitted and are
  accepted for egcs-1.1 will not have been installed by this date due to
  EOQ committments for many of the Cygnus volunteers.

  <p> After July 3, 1998, only bugfix submissions will be considered for
  the egcs-1.1 release.

  <p> By July 3, 1998, we also want to have a testing plan and release
  criteria in place.

  <p><li> <b>July 11, 1998. Branch Creation & Testing</b>.
  <p> the egcs-1.1 branch will be created on July 11, 1998 and snapshots will
  occur from the egcs-1.1 branch instead of the mainline sources.

  <p> By July 11, 1998 it is hoped that all new features, optimizations, etc
  slated for the egcs-1.1 release have been installed into the source tree.
  
  <p> Wide scale, focused testing should start on or before July 11th.

  <p> <li> <b>July 31, 1998. Critial Bug Freeze Date</b>.
  <p>July 31, 1998 is the target date for freezing the sources.  After this
  date only critical bugfixes will be accepted for inclusion in egcs-1.1.
  This may be overly optimistic, but it's important to have a goal to shoot
  for.

</ul>

<p> The release should go out as soon as possible in early August.

<p> Note that we have the ability to install changes into the mainline
sources during this process.  However, the main focus will be on the egcs-1.1
specific issues.

<p> It is highly likely that some minor releases will follow egcs-1.1 (ie
egcs-1.1.1, egcs-1.1.2, etc).  So if a critical bug does not get fixed for
egcs-1.1, it may be fixed in one of the minor releases.

<p> We plan to do a post-release review of the proposed schedule vs
the actual schedule used for egcs-1.1 so that we can improve the process
in the future.


<p> When the testing plan and release criteria are available, they'll
be added to this page.  As will the proposed release announcement,
lists of new features, etc etc.
