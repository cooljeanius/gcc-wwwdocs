<p>The egcs project is rapidly approaching its second major release
(egcs-1.1).

<p>This page is meant to provide information about the current schedule
for egcs-1.1, the testing/release criteria for egcs-1.1, new features
to be found in egcs-1.1, etc.

<p>The tenative schedule for the egcs-1.1 release is:

<ul>
  <li> <b>July 3, 1998. Feature freeze date</b>.
  <p>All new features, optimizations, etc need to be <i>submitted</i> by
  this date.  It is very likely we will not be able to integrate all the
  submissions, but we want to have all of them available for evaluation by
  this date.

  <p> It is also possible some patches which have been submitted and are
  accepted for egcs-1.1 will not have been installed by this date due to
  EOQ committments for many of the Cygnus volunteers.

  <p> After July 3, 1998, only bugfix submissions will be considered for
  the egcs-1.1 release.

  <p> By July 3, 1998, we also want to have a testing plan and release
  criteria in place.

  <p><li> <b>July 11, 1998. Branch Creation & Testing</b>.
  <p> We will create the egcs-1.1 branch on this date and snapshots will
  occur from the egcs-1.1 branch instead of the mainline sources.

  <p> By this date we'd like to have all the new features, optimizations,
  etc slated for the egcs-1.1 release installed in the source tree.
  
  <p> We also expect wide scale, focused testing to start on July 11th.

  <p> <li> <b>July 31, 1998. Critial Bug Freeze Date</b>.
  <p>If at all possible we would like to see the release sources freeze
  except for critical bug fixes by July 31st.  This may be overly optimistic,
  but it's important to have a goal to shoot for.

</ul>

<p> I would like to release as soon as possible in early August.


<p> Note that we have the ability to install changes into the mainline
sources during this process.  However, I personally will be focusing more
and more on egcs-1.1 specific issues.

<p> It is highly likely we will have some minor releases based on egcs-1.1;
we will cross that bridge when the time comes.

<p> I also want to do a post-release review of the proposed schedule vs
the actual schedule used for egcs-1.1 so that we can improve the process
in the future.


<p> When the testing plan and release criteria are available, they'll
be added to this page.  As will the proposed release announcement,
lists of new features, etc etc.
