<h1>GCC 4.3 Release Series<br />Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>


<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A new <em>forward propagation</em> pass on RTL was added.  The new pass
      replaces several slower transformations, resulting in compile-time
      improvements as well as better code generation in some cases.</li>

    <li> A new command line switch <code>-frecord-gcc-switches</code> has been
    added to GCC, although it is only enabled for some targets.  The switch
    causes the command line that was used to invoke the compiler to be recorded
    into the object file that is being created.  The exact format of this
    recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it usually takes
    the form of a note section containing ASCII text.  The switch is related to
    the <code>-fverbose-asm</code> switch, but that one only records the
    information in the assembler output file as comments, so the information
    never reaches the object file.
    </li>

  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>A new internal representation for GIMPLE statements has been
      contributed, resulting in compile-time memory savings.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<h3>C family</h3>

<h3>C++</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Experimental support for the upcoming ISO C++ standard, C++0x,
  has been added. This support can be enabled with the
  <code>-std=c++0x</code> or <code>-std=gnu++0x</code> compiler
  options. The following C++0x features are enabled by this
  experimental mode: 
  <ul>
    <li><a
  href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1720.html">Static
  assertions</a></li>
    <li><a
  href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1653.htm">C99
  preprocessor</a></li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>The <code>-Wparentheses</code> option now works for C++ as it
  does for C.  It warns if parentheses are omitted when operators with
  confusing precedence are nested.  It also warns about ambiguous else
  statements.  Since <code>-Wparentheses</code> is enabled by
  <code>-Wall</code>, this may cause additional warnings with existing
  C++ code which uses <code>-Wall</code>.  These new warnings may be
  disabled by using <code>-Wall -Wno-parentheses</code>.</li>

  <li>The <code>-Wmissing-declarations</code> now works for C++ as it
  does for C.</li>

  </ul>
  
<h3>Fortran</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The <code>
    <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Code-Gen-Options.html#Code-Gen-Options"
    >-fexternal-blas</a></code> option has been added, which
    generates calls to BLAS routines for intrinsic matrix operations such
    as <code>matmul</code> rather than using the built-in algorithms.</li>
    <li>The GNU Fortran compiler now uses 4-byte record markers by default
    for unformatted files to be compatible with g77 and most other compilers.
    The implementation allows for records greater than 2 GB and compatible
    with several other compilers. Older versions of gfortran used by default
    8-byte record markers (on most systems). In order to change length of
    the record markers, e.g. to read unformatted files created by older
    gfortran versions, the <code> 
    <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Runtime-Options.html"
    >-frecord-marker=8</a></code> option can be used.</li>
    <li>Fortran 2003 support has been extended:
    <ul>
      <li>Intrinsic statements <code>VOLATILE</code> and <code>IMPORT</code></li>
      <li>Intrinsic module <code>ISO_ENV_FORTRAN</code></li>
    </ul></li>
  </ul>

<h3>Java (GCJ)</h3>

<h2>New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

<h3>IA-32/x86-64</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tuning for Intel Core 2 processors is available via
        <code>-mtune=core2</code> and <code>-march=core2</code>.</li>
    <li>Tuning for AMD Geode processors is available via
        <code>-mtune=geode</code> and <code>-march=geode</code>.</li>
    <li>Support for SSSE3 built-in functions and code generation are
	available via <code>-mssse3</code>.</li>
  </ul>
