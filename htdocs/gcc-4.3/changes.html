<h1>GCC 4.3 Release Series<br />Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>


<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A new <em>forward propagation</em> pass on RTL was added.  The new pass
      replaces several slower transformations, resulting in compile-time
      improvements as well as better code generation in some cases.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<h3>C family</h3>

<h3>C++</h3>

<h3>Fortran</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The <code>
    <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Code-Gen-Options.html#Code-Gen-Options"
    >-fexternal-blas</a></code> option has been added, which
    generates calls to BLAS routines for intrinsic matrix operations such
    as <code>matmul</code> rather than using the built-in algorithms.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Java (GCJ)</h3>

<h2>New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

<h2>Documentation improvements</h2>
