<h1>GCC Coding Conventions Rationale and Discussion</h1>

<h2>C and C++ Language Conventions</h2>

<h3>Language Use</h3>

<h4>Inlining Functions</h4>

<p>
Inlining functions has a potential cost in object size,
working set size, compile time, and debuggablity.
These costs should not be borne without some evidence
that the inlining pays for itself.
</p>


<h2>C++ Language Conventions</h2>

<h3>Language Use</h3>

<h4 id="variables">Variable Definitions</h4>

<p>
Defining variables when they are first needed
reduces the cognitive burden on the programmer.
It also eases converting common sub-expressions
into a defined and reused variable.
</p>

<p>
Defining and testing variables in control expressions
has the same advantages as above.
In addition, it restricts the scope of the variable
to the region in which it is known to be sensible.
</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
if (info *q = get_any_available_info ()) {
  // q is known to be non-NULL, and so do useful processing.
}
</code></pre></blockquote>


<h4 id="struct">Struct Definitions</h4>

<p>
In the C++ standard,
structs and classes differ only in the default access rules.
We prefer to use these two keywords to signal more information.
</p>

<p>
Note that under this definition,
structs may have member functions.
This freedom is useful for transitional code.
</p>


<h4 id="class">Class Definitions</h4>

<p>
Forgetting to write a special member function is a known programming problem.
Some authors recommend always defining all special member functions.
Such classes are less efficient.
First, these definitions may prevent the compiler
from passing the class in a register.
Second, these definitions may prevent the compiler
from using more efficient methods for copying.
Adding a comment that the default is intended
preserves the performance while ensuring that
the function was not forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Classes generally are either value classes or identity classes.
Copy constructors and assignment operators are fine for value classes.
They are often not appropriate to identity classes.
These classes should delete, or disable, these functions.
Marking such functions as follows
will enable compiling against C++03,
and later modifying them for C++11.
</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
TypeName(const TypeName&amp;) /*DELETED*/;
void operator=(const TypeName&amp;) /*DELETED*/;
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
Multiple inheritance is confusing and rarely useful.
When it is needed though, there may be no substitute.
Seek guidance, review and feedback from the wider community.
</p>

<p>
Using virtual functions increases the size of instances of the class
by at least one pointer.
In heavily allocated types, such as trees, GIMPLE or RTL,
this size increase could have adverse performance impacts.
On the other hand,
virtual functions can often reduce the size of instances
by binding information into the virtual tables and the virtual functions.
For example, various type tags need not be present.
Other attributes can be inferred
from type and more general information,
or from extending the class hierarchy at the leaves.
So, even though trees are heavily allocated,
it remains to be seen whether virtual functions would increase the size. 
Virtual functions are implemented as indirect function calls,
which can inhibit some optimization,
particularly inlining.
Therefore virtual functions should be added in heavily allocated classes
only after size and performance studies.
However, virtual functions are acceptable where we use hooks today,
as they are already essentially virtual tables.
</p>

<p>
There are good reasons to make private
all data members of non-POD classes.
However, in converting from C to C++,
there is a necessary transition that has public data members.
</p>


<h4 id="constructors">Constructors and Destructors</h4>

<p>
The compiler implicitly initializes all non-POD fields.
Any initialization in the body of the constructor implies extra work.
</p>

<p>
Polymorphic classes without a virtual destructor
are almost certainly incorrect.
</p>

<h4 id="conversions">Conversions</h4>

<p>
C++ uses single-argument constructors for implicit type conversion.
Wide use of implicit conversion can cause some very surprising results.
</p>

<p>
C++03 has no explicit conversion operators,
and hence using them cannot avoid suprises.
Wait for C++11.
</p>


<h4 id="overfunc">Overloading Functions</h4>

<p>
Function overloading can be confusing.
However, in some cases introducing new function names adds little value,
as in the current distinction
between <code>build_index_type</code> and <code>build_index_2_type</code>.
</p>

<p>
The essential problem is to use overloading in a way that
improves conciseness without introducing confusion.
To that end, consider the following advice.
</p>

<p>
You may overload if the overloaded name supports an action notion.
For example, the C++ standard's notion of swap.
</p>

<p>
You may <em>not</em> overload
when implicit conversions among argument types may yield unintended effects.
For example,
</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
void swizzle (int arg);
void swizzle (const char *arg);
... swizzle (NULL); ...
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
results in an unintended call to the <code>int</code> overload on some systems.
In practice, the problem that this restriction addresses
arises more from bad user-defined implicit conversion operators.
See ISO C++
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2437.pdf">
N2437</a>
and 
ISO C++
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2514.html">
N2514</a>.
</p>

<p>
You may overload if a single argument, in a single position,
has multiple representations. For example,
</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
void append (const char *str);
void append (std::string str);
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
You may <em>not</em> overload
if more than one argument constitutes the representation of some data notion.
For example, in
</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
void register (int house, const char *street, int zipcode);
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
the arguments are a representation of addresses.
Instead, the overload should be on addresses.
</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
void register(const Address &amp;addr);
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
This restriction cannot apply to constructors,
where the whole point is to collect representational data.
</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
Address::Address (int house, const char *street, int zipcode);
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
Notwithstanding the restrictions above, you may overload to detect errors.
That is, if unsigned numbers are good, but signed numbers are bad,
you could overload
</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>
void munch (unsigned int arg);
void munch (int arg);
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>
and simply not define the signed int version.
Anyone using it would get a link-time error.
(The C++11 standard has a syntax
that enables compile-time detection of the problem.)
</p>


<h4 id="overoper">Overloading Operators</h4>

<p>
Using <code>[]</code> to index a vector is unsurprising,
but using <code>[]</code> to query a database over a network
is bound to cause performance problems.
</p>


<h4 id="default">Default Arguments</h4>

<p>
Expensive default arguments can cause hard-to-identify performance problems.
</p>

<p>
Default arguments cause confusion
when attempting to take the address of a function.
They clause client code taking the address of a function
to break when a default argument is replaced by a specialized overload.
So, default arguments should generally not be used
in customer-facing interfaces.
Consider function overloading instead.
</p>


<h4 id="namespace">Namespaces</h4>

<p>
Putting <code>using</code> directives
or namespace-scope <code>using</code> declarations
into header files can change client code in surprising ways.
</p>

<p>
Using them within an implementation file can help conciseness.
</p>


<h4 id="RTTI">RTTI and <code>dynamic_cast</code></h4>

<p>
Disabling RTTI will save space in the compiler.
</p>


<h4 id="casts">Other Casts</h4>

<p>
C++-style casts are very explicit in the intended transformation.
Making intent clear avoids bugs and helps with other programmers.
</p>


<h4 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h4>

<p>
The current compiler code is not exception safe.
</p>

<p>
Disabling exceptions will permit
the compiler itself to be slightly more optimized. 
</p>

<p>
Aborting the compiler is a reasonable response to unexpected problems.
</p>

<p>
We would like the compiler to be exception safe,
to permit reconsideration of the exception convention.
This change would require a significant change in style,
adopting "resource acquisition is initialization" (RAII).
We would be using
<code>shared_ptr</code> (from TR1's <code>&lt;memory&gt;</code>)
or <code>unique_ptr</code> (from C++11).
</p>

<h4 id="stdlib">The Standard Library</h4>

<p>
At present, C++ provides no great advantage for i18n.
GCC does type checking for <code>printf</code> arguments,
so the type insecurity of <code>printf</code> is moot,
but the clarity in layout persists.
</p>

<h3>Formatting Conventions</h3>

<h4 id="names">Names</h4>

<p>
Prefixing data members with <code>m_</code>
highlights the extra overhead of access to fields over local variables.
Think of the leading <code>m_</code> as being similar to the
<code>*</code> dereference operator.
</p>

<p>
When using the above convention,
the constructor parameter names
and getter member function names
can use the more concise non-underscore form.
