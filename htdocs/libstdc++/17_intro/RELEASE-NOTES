Release Notes   
-------------
The Standard C++ Library v3, or libstdc++-2.90.x, is an ongoing
project to implement the ISO 14882 Standard C++ library as described
in chapters 17 through 27 and annex D, as a drop-in replacement
for the current (ARM-conformant) library.

This is the ninth snapshot of the libstdc++ rewrite.  It is still
incomplet and incorrekt. It's a lot less incomplete and incorrect than
some of the earlier snapshots though, and quite usable.

The Standard C++ Library v3, or libstdc++-2.90.x, follows an open
development model, attempting to be fully buzzword, bazaar, and GNU
compliant. Full details on participating, including contributor
guidelines, mailing list subscription, mailing list archives,
up-to-date documentation, and various and sundry other details can be
found at the following URL:

New: 
--- 

- MT safe string. Supported CPUs are alpha, powerpc, x86, sparc32 and sparc64.
- Configure support for --enable-threads=posix, as well as initial IO
  locking implementation.
- Support for native building on Solaris 2.5.1, Solaris 2.6, Solaris
  2.7, cygwin, [alpha, powerpc, x86]-linux, and preliminary support for
  Irix and Aix4.2, Aix 4.3 hosts.
- --enable-namespaces is on by default.
- Configure and Makefile support for "drop-in" replacement to
  libstdc++-v2 completed. It is now possible to bootstrap g++, and
  have g++ find libstdc++-v3 headers and libraries by default.
- Synched with CVS egcs libio. 
- Cygwin native compiling supported.
- Cross compiling and embedded targets (newlib) with multilibs support added.
- SGI's strstream implementation has been added.
- Copyright on all sources assigned to the FSF.
- Configure, build and install documentation has been added.
- Support to enable long long has been added.
- More valarray improvements.
- Extractors and inserters for std::complex have been added.
- Extractors and inserters for void* have been fixed.
- autoconf macros are now in _GLIBCPP_ namespace.
- group checking for num_get implemented.
- Many, many bug fixes.

--------
Places have changed from previous snapshots.  The web page, which has
information about joining the mailing list and searching its archives,
CVS access, and contribution information is now at:

  http://sourceware.cygnus.com/libstdc++/

Please note that the mailing list has recently moved, and is now
hosted on sourceware.cygnus.com. (The web site above has the most
up-to-date info.)
   
Obtain the library snapshot via ftp (including these release notes) from

The library is maintained by Benjamin Kosnik, Nathan Myers, Gabriel
Dos Reis, and Ulrich Drepper.  


Development tools:
------------------
You will need a recent version of gcc to compile the snapshot of
libstdc++. The recently released gcc-2.95.2 works well. In addition,
you may need up-to-date tools for modifying Makefiles and regenerating
configure scripts: automake (version 1.4 from Cygnus, not the one on
the net) and autoconf (version 2.13 and higher). Please see the
website for more info on where to obtain these additional tools.

If you compile programs -fnew-abi -fno-honor-std, uses of RTTI and
certain other language features will link only if you build your
compiler's libgcc using the same flags.  (The defaults use the old
abi.)  Using -fnew-abi offers real benefits, but note that it is not
stable: later snapshots will *not* be binary-compatible with code
compiled with older snapshots. See the configuration options page in
the Documentation section.
