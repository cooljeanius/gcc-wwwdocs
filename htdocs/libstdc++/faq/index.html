<!-- I suspect these will mostly be links to/into existing documents. -->
   <H2><A NAME="1_1">1.1 What is libstdc++-v3?</A></H2>
      <P>The GNU Standard C++ Library v3, or libstdc++-2.90.x, is an 
         ongoing project to implement the ISO 14882 Standard C++ library 
         as described in chapters 17 through 27 and annex D.  As the 
         library reaches stable plateaus, it is captured in a snapshot
         and released.  The current release is <A
HREF="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/libstdc++/libstdc++-2.90.8.tar.gz">the
         ninth snapshot</A>.  For those who want to see exactly how
         far the project has come, or just want the latest
         bleeding-edge code, the up-to-date source is available over
         anonymous CVS, and can even be browsed over the Web (see below). 
      </P> 
      <P>A more formal description of the V3 goals can be found in the
         official <A HREF="../17_intro/DESIGN">design document</A>. 
      </P> 

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="1_2">1.2 Why should I use libstdc++?</A></H2>
      <P>The completion of the ISO C++ standardization gave the
         C++ community a powerful set of reuseable tools in the form
         of the C++ Standard Library.  However, all existing C++
         implementations are (as the Draft Standard used to say)
         &quot;incomplet and incorrekt,&quot; and many suffer from
         limitations of the compilers that use them.
      </P> 
      <P>The GNU C/C++/FORTRAN/&lt;pick-a-language&gt; compiler
         (<TT>gcc</TT>, <TT>g++</TT>, etc) is widely considered to be
         one of the leading compilers in the world.  Its development
         has recently been taken over by the 
         <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC team</A>.  All of
         the rapid development and near-legendary
     <A
HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/buildstat.html">portability</A>
         that are the hallmarks of an open-source project are being
         applied to libstdc++.
      </P>
      <P>That means that all of the Standard classes and functions
         (such as <TT>string</TT>, <TT>vector&lt;&gt;</TT>, iostreams,
         and algorithms) will be freely available and fully compliant.
         Programmers will no longer need to &quot;roll their own&quot;
         nor be worried about platform-specific incompatabilities.
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="1_3">1.3 Who's in charge of it?</A></H2>
      <P>The libstdc++ project is contributed to by several developers
         all over the world, in the same way as GCC (EGCS) or Linux.
         Benjamin Kosnik, Gabriel Dos Reis, Nathan Myers, and Ulrich
         Drepper are the lead maintainers of the CVS archive.
      </P>
      <P>Development and discussion is held on the libstdc++ mailing
         list. Subscribing to the list, or searching the list
         archives, is open to everyone.  You can read instructions for
         doing so on the <A HREF="../index.html">homepage</A>.  If you
         have questions, ideas, code, or are just curious, sign up!
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="1_4">1.4 How do I get libstdc++?</A></H2>
      <P>The ninth (and latest) snapshot of libstdc++-v3 is <A
HREF="ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/libstdc++/libstdc++-2.90.8.tar.gz">
         available via ftp</A>.
      </P>
      <P>The <A HREF="../index.html">homepage</A>
         has instructions for retrieving the latest CVS sources, and for
         browsing the CVS sources over the web.
      </P>
      <P>The subset commonly known as the Standard Template Library
         (chapters 23 through 25, mostly) is adapted from the SGI STL,
         which is also an ongoing work.<!-- Possibly a link to SGI's
         STL here. -->
      </P> 

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="1_5">1.5 When is libstdc++ going to be finished?</A></H2>
      <P>Nathan Myers gave the best of all possible answers in <A 
         HREF="http://www.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=469581698&fmt=text">a 
         Usenet article</A>.</P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="1_6">1.6 How do I contribute to the effort?</A></H2>
      <P>Here is <A HREF="../17_intro/contribute.html">a
         page devoted to this topic</A>.  Subscribing to the mailing
         list (see above, or the homepage) is a very good idea if you
         have something to contribute, or if you have spare time and
         want to help.  Contributions don't have to be in the form of
         source code; anybody who is willing to help write
         documentation, for example, or has found a bug in code that
         we all thought was working, is more than welcome!
      </P> 

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="1_7">1.7 What happened to libg++?  I need that!</A></H2>
      <P>The most recent libg++ README states that libg++ is no longer
         being actively maintained.  It should not be used for new
         projects, and is only being kicked along to support older code.
      </P>
      <P>The libg++ was designed and created when there was no Standard
         to provide guidance.  Classes like linked lists are now provided
         for by <TT>list&lt;T&gt;</TT> and do not need to be created by
         <TT>genclass</TT>.  (For that matter, templates exist now and
         are well-supported, whereas genclass (mostly) predates them.)
      </P>
      <P>There are other classes in libg++ that are not specified in the
         ISO Standard (e.g., statistical analysis).  While there are a
         lot of really useful things that are used by a lot of people
         (e.g., statistics :-), the Standards Committee couldn't include
         everything, and so a lot of those &quot;obvious&quot; classes
         didn't get included.
      </P>
      <P>Since libstdc++ is an implementation of the Standard Library, we
         have no plans at this time to include non-Standard utilities
         in the implementation, however handy they are.  (The extensions
         provided in the SGI STL aren't maintained by us and don't get
         a lot of our attention, because they don't require a lot of our
         time.)  It is entirely plausable that the &quot;useful stuff&quot;
         from libg++ might be extracted into an updated utilities library,
         but nobody has stated such a project yet.
      </P>
      <!-- The advertisement, so to speak, might have to go.  Hmmmmm.  -->
      <P>(The <A HREF="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</A> site houses free
         C++ libraries that do varying things, and happened to be started
         by members of the Standards Committee.  Certain &quot;useful
         stuff&quot; classes will probably migrate there.)
      </P>
      <P>For the bold and/or desperate, the
         <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/fom_serv/cache/33.html">GCC FAQ</A>
         describes where to find the last libg++ source.
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="1_8">1.8 What if I have more questions?</A></H2>
      <P>If you have read the README and RELEASE-NOTES files, and your
         question remains unanswered, then just ask the mailing list.
         At present, you do not need to be subscribed to the list to
         send a message to it.  More information is available on the
         homepage (including how to browse the list archives); to send
         to the list, use <A HREF="mailto:libstdc++@sources.redhat.com">

<H1><A NAME="2_0">2.0 Installation</A></H1>
   <H2><A NAME="2_1">2.1 How do I install libstdc++-v3?</A></H2>
      <P>Complete instructions are not given here (this is a FAQ, not
         an installation document), but the tools required are few:
         <UL>
            <LI> A release of libstdc++.
            <LI> A recent release of GCC (version 2.95 works). Note
                 that building GCC is much easier and more automated
                 than building the GCC 2.[78] series was. 
            <LI> If you plan on hacking around with the makefiles, you
	         will need the tools <A 
HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/autoconf/">autoconf</A>and <A 
HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/automake/">automake</A>. 
            <LI> GNU Make is the only make that supports these makefiles. 
         </UL>
      </P>
      <P>The file <A HREF="../documentation.html">documentation.html</A>
         provides a good overview of the steps necessary to build, install,
         and use the library.  Instructions for configuring the library
         with new flags such as --enable-threads are there also.
      </P>
      <P>The top-level install.html and
         <A HREF="../17_intro/RELEASE-NOTES">RELEASE-NOTES</A> files contain
         the exact build and installation instructions.  You may wish to
         browse those files over CVSweb ahead of time to get a feel for
         what's required.  RELEASE-NOTES is located in the
         &quot;.../docs/17_intro/&quot; directory of the distribution.
      </P> 

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="2_2">2.2 Is this a drop-in replacement for the
                         libstdc++ that's shipped with g++?</A></H2>
      <P>Yes, as of 2.90.8, it is intended as such.</P>
      <P>The installation instructions cover this in more detail, but
         replacing the older library requires rebuilding some of the
         code that comes with g++.  You will need sources for the 2.95.2
         compiler in order to build this snapshot.  Building the library
         on its own and then using -I/-L will no longer work.
      </P>
      <P>After the 2.90.8 snapshot, the library sources were integrated
         into the compiler sources.  Future releases of the compiler will
         ship with libstdc++-v3.
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="2_3">2.3 What is this CVS thing that you
                         keep mentioning?</A></H2>
      <P>The <EM>Concurrent Versions System</EM> is one of several revision
         control packages.  It was selected for GNU projects because it's
	 free (speech), free (beer), and very high quality.  The <A
         HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/cvs/cvs.html">CVS entry in
         the GNU software catalogue</A> has a better description as 
         well as a
	 <A HREF="http://www.cyclic.com/">link to the makers of CVS</A>. 
      </P>
      <P>The &quot;anonymous client checkout&quot; feature of CVS is
         similar to anonymous FTP in that it allows anyone to retrieve
         the latest libstdc++ sources.
      </P>
      <P>After the first of April, American users will have a
         &quot;/pharmacy&quot; command-line option...
         <!-- wonder how long that'll live -->
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="2_4">2.4 How do I know if it works?</A></H2>
      <P>libstdc++-v3 comes with its own testsuite.  You do not need
         to actually install the library (&quot;<TT>gmake
         install</TT>&quot;) to run the testsuite.
      </P>
      <P>To run the testsuite on the library after building it, use
         &quot;gmake check&quot; while in your build directory.  To run
         the testsuite on the library after building and installing it,
         use &quot;gmake check-install&quot; instead.
      </P>
      <P>The testsuite subdirectory in your build directory will then
         contain three files of the form YYYYMMDD-mkcheck*.txt.  One of
         them (-mkcheck.txt itself) contains the results of the tests;
         this can be mailed to the list.  The other files (-mkchecklog.txt
         and -mkcheckfiles.txt) contain messages from the compiler while
         building the test programs, and a list of the tests to be run,
         respectively.
      </P>
      <P>If you are using the libgcc.a-rebuilding method to enable std::
         you might find that the testsuite starts dying with nasty linker
         errors.  This is symptomatic of the rebuilt libgcc.a not being
         installed; the previous one is still in use.
      </P>
      <P>If you find bugs in the testsuite programs themselves, or if
         you think of a new test program that should be added to the
         suite, <B>please</B> write up your idea and send it to the list!
      </P>

<H1><A NAME="3_0">3.0 Platform-Specific Issues</A></H1>
   <H2><A NAME="3_1">3.1 Can libstdc++-v3 be used with &lt;my
                         favorite compiler&gt;?</A></H2>
      <P>Probably not.  Yet.</P>
      <P>Because GCC advances so rapidly, development and testing of
         libstdc++ is being done almost entirely under that compiler.
         If you are curious about whether other, lesser compilers
         (*grin*) support libstdc++, you are more than welcome to try.
         Configuring and building the library (see above) will still
         require certain tools, however.  Also keep in mind that
         <EM>building</EM> libstdc++ does not imply that your compiler
         will be able to <EM>use</EM> all of the features found in the
         C++ Standard Library.
      </P>
      <P>Since the goal of ISO Standardization is for all C++
         implementations to be able to share code, the final libstdc++
         should, in theory, be useable under any ISO-compliant
         compiler.  It will still be targeted and optimized for
         GCC/g++, however.
      </P> 

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="3_2">3.2 Building under Cygwin hangs/explodes!?</A></H2>
      <P>Sometimes, yes.  You're probably in the middle of generating
         the <TT>numeric_limits</TT> specializations when it hangs,
         right?  Thought so...
      </P> 
      <P>The <TT>&lt;limits&gt;</TT> header and its associated library
         code are platform-specific.  These files get generated from
         scratch during installation, and it is this generator that is
         hanging.  More specifically, the only sure way to determine
         what the <TT>numeric_limits&lt;T&gt;::traps</TT> boolean
         should be is to actually divide by zero and see if it is
         trapped or not.
      </P>
      <P>Under NT, this will occasionally just hang.  On those
         occasions when the test does not hang, the zero-division is
         in fact trapped.  That doesn't prevent hanging elsewhere.
      </P>
      <P>You have two options.  You can get a newer cygwin1.dll (see the
         Cygwin paragraph in the
	 <A HREF="../install.html">installation instructions</A>).
         Or you can get a prebuilt set of bits/std_limits.h and
         src/limitsMEMBERS.cc files from Mumit Khan's
         <A HREF="http://www.xraylith.wisc.edu/~khan/software/gnu-win32/libstdc++-v3.html">Cygwin-related website</A>.

   <H2><A NAME="4_2">4.2 Bugs in gcc/g++ (not libstdc++-v3)</A></H2>
      <P>This is by no means meant to be complete nor exhaustive, but
         mentions some problems that users may encounter when building
         or using libstdc++.  If you are experiencing one of these
         problems, you can find more information on the libstdc++ and
         the GCC mailing lists.
      </P>
      <UL>
         <LI>When using associative containers (like <TT>map</TT>), and
             compiling with <TT>-O3</TT> (or <TT>-finline-functions</TT>)
             and <TT>-Winline</TT>, I get a zillion errors like:
             <!-- Careful, the leading spaces in PRE show up directly. -->
             <PRE>
   .../include/g++/stl_tree.h: In function `int __black_count(struct __rb_tree_node_base *, struct __rb_tree_node_base *)':
   .../include/g++/stl_tree.h:1045: warning: can't inline call to `int __black_count(struct __rb_tree_node_base *, struct __rb_tree_node_base *)'
   .../include/g++/stl_tree.h:1053: warning: called from here
             </PRE>
             <P>This has been discussed a number of times; the problem
                is that __black_count is marked inline but is also a
                recursive function.  As of 12 July 1999, it has been
                rewritten into an optimized non-recursive form, so 
                fresh checkouts/releases should no longer see this warning.
                (The compiler can usually figure out how to make that
                transformation on its own.)
             </P>

         <LI>The reason that EGCS 1.1.2 cannot be used to build the
             library is that lookups do not work properly, and so the
             compiler will ICE when building the locale-related source
             files.  This has been fixed in GCC 2.95.
      </UL>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="4_3">4.3 Bugs in the C++ language/lib specification</A></H2>
      <P>Yes, unfortunately, there are some.  In a <A 
HREF="/ml/libstdc++/1998/msg00006.html">message
to the list</A>, Nathan Myers announced that he has started a list of
         problems in the ISO C++ Standard itself, especially with
         regard to the chapters that concern the library.  The list
         itself is <A
         HREF="http://www.cantrip.org/draft-bugs.txt">posted on his
         website</A>.  Developers who are having problems interpreting
         the Standard may wish to consult his notes.
      </P>
      <P>For those people who are not part of the ISO Library Group
         (i.e., nearly all of us needing to read this page in the first
         place :-), a public list of the library defects is occasionally
         published <A HREF="http://anubis.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc22/wg21/">here</A>.
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="4_4">4.4 Things in libstdc++ that look like bugs</A></H2>
      <P>There are things which are not bugs in the compiler (4.2) nor
         the language specification (4.3), but aren't really bugs in
         libstdc++, either.  Really!
      </P>
      <P>The biggest of these is the quadzillions of warnings about the
         library headers emitted when <TT>-Weffc++</TT> is used.  Making
         libstdc++ &quot;-Weffc++-clean&quot; is not a goal of the project,
         for a few reasons.  Mainly, that option tries to enforce
         object-oriented programming, while the Standard Library isn't
         necessarily trying to be OO.  There are multiple solutions
         under discussion.
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="4_5">4.5 Aw, that's easy to fix!</A></H2>
      <P>If you have found a bug in the library and you think you have
         a working fix, then send it in!  The main GCC site has a page
         on <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/contribute.html">submitting
         patches</A> that covers the procedure, but for libstdc++ you
         should of course send the patch to our mailing list, not the
         GCC mailing list.  The libstdc++
         <A HREF="../17_intro/contribute.html">contributors' page</A>
         also talks about how to submit patches.
      </P>
      <P>In addition to the description, the patch, and the ChangeLog
         entry, it is a Good Thing if you can additionally create a small
         test program to test for the presence of the bug that your
         patch fixes.  Bugs have a way of being reintroduced; if an old
         bug creeps back in, it will be caught immediately by the 
         <A HREF="#2_4">testsuite</A> -- but only if such a test exists.
      </P>

<HR>
<H1><A NAME="5_0">5.0 Miscellaneous</A></H1>
   <H2><A NAME="5_1">5.1 string::iterator is not char*;
                     vector&lt;T&gt;::iterator is not T*</A></H2>
      <P>If you have code that depends on container&lt;T&gt; iterators
         being implemented as pointer-to-T, your code is broken.
      </P>
      <P>While there are arguments for iterators to be implemented in
         that manner, A) they aren't very good ones in the long term,
         and B) they were never guaranteed by the Standard anyway.  The
         type-safety achieved by making iterators a real class rather
         than a typedef for <TT>T*</TT> outweighs nearly all opposing
         arguments.
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="5_2">5.2 What's next after libstdc++-v3?</A></H2>
      <P>Hopefully, not much.  The goal of libstdc++-v3 is to produce
         a fully-compliant, fully-portable Standard Library.  After that,
         we're mostly done:  there won't <EM>be</EM> any more compliance
         work to do.
      </P>
      <P>The ISO Committee will meet periodically to review Defect Reports
         in the C++ Standard.  Undoubtably some of these will result in
         changes to the Standard, which will be reflected in patches to
         libstdc++.  Some of that is already happening, see 4.2.
      </P>
      <P>The current libstdc++ contains extensions to the Library which
         must be explicitly requested by client code (for example, the
         hash tables from SGI).  Other extensions may be added to
         libstdc++-v3 if they seem to be &quot;standard&quot; enough.
         (For example, the &quot;long long&quot; type from C99.)
         Bugfixes and rewrites (to improve or fix thread safety, for
         instance) will of course be a continuing task.
      </P>
      <P><A
HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libstdc++/1999/msg00080.html">This
         question</A> about the next libstdc++ prompted some brief but

      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="5_3">5.3 What about the STL from SGI?</A></H2>
      <P>The <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL/">STL from SGI</A>
         is merged into libstdc++-v3 with changes as necessary.  
         Currently release 3.3 is being used.  Changes in the STL
         usually produce some weird bugs and lots of changes in the
         rest of the libstd++ source as we scramble to keep up. :-)
      </P>
      <P>In particular, <TT>string</TT> is not from SGI and makes no
         use of their &quot;rope&quot; class (which is included as an
         optional extension), nor is <TT>valarray</TT> and some others.
         Classes like <TT>vector&lt;&gt;</TT> are, however.
      </P>
      <P>The FAQ for SGI's STL (one jump off of their main page) is
         recommended reading.
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="5_4">5.4 Extensions and Backward Compatibility</A></H2>
      <P>Although you can specify <TT>-I</TT> options to make the
         preprocessor search the g++-v3/ext and /backward directories,
         it is better to refer to files there by their path, as in:
         <!-- Careful, the leading spaces in PRE show up directly. -->
         <PRE>
       #include &lt;ext/hash_map&gt;
         </PRE>
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="5_5">5.5 Compiling with &quot;-fnew-abi&quot;</A></H2>
      <P>The library mostly works if you compile it (and programs you
         link with it) using &quot;-fnew-abi -fno-honor-std&quot; on a
         vanilla GCC compiler.  However, some features, such as RTTI
         and error handlers, might not link properly with a vanilla
         libgcc built in GCC under the old ABI.  If you rebuild libgcc
         using the &quot;-f&quot; flags above, you can get both complete
         language support and full benefits of -fnew-abi -- short
         mangled symbol names, far more efficient exception handling,
         and empty base optimization, to name a few.  (Note that the
         new ABI may change from one GCC snapshot to the next, so you
         would have to rebuild all your libraries each time you get a
         new compiler snapshot.) 
      </P>
      <P>Towards the end of July 1999, this subject was brought up again
         on the mailing list under a different name.  The related
         <A HREF="/ml/libstdc++/1999-q3/msg00066.html">thread</A>
         (by the name HOWTO-honor-std) is very instructive.  More info
         is at the end of RELEASE-NOTES.
      </P>
      <P>This functionality is now automated and turned on by default.
      </P>

<HR>
   <H2><A NAME="5_6">5.6 Is libstdc++-v3 thread-safe?</A></H2>
      <P>Quick answer:  no, as of 2.90.8 (ninth snapshot), the
         library is not appropriate for multithreaded access.  The
         string class is MT-safe.
      </P>
      <P>This is assuming that your idea of &quot;multithreaded&quot;
         is the same as ours...  The general question of multithreading
         and libstdc++-v3 is addressed in the chapter-specific advice for
<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/libstdc++/17_intro/howto.html#3">Library
         Introduction</A>.  Threadsafe containers are covered in
         more detail in

   <H2><A NAME="5_7">5.7 How do I get a copy of the ISO C++ Standard?</A></H2>
      <P>Copies of the full ISO 14882 standard are available on line
         via the ISO mirror site for committee members.  Non-members,
         or those who have not paid for the privilege of sitting on
         the committee and sustained their two-meeting commitment for
         voting rights, may get a copy of the standard from their
         respective national standards organization.  In the USA,
         this national standards organization is ANSI and their
         website is right <A HREF="http://www.ansi.org">here</A>.
