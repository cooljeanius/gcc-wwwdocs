<h3>Status</h3>

<hr>
<p>For release 3.0.95, two tarballs are available.  The first,
   <a href="download.html">libstdc++-v3.0.95-gcc-3.1.x.tar.gz</a>, is for
   use with current dvelopment GCC (and the 3.1 branch, a few months from
   now).  The second,
   <a href="download.html">libstdc++-v3.0.95-gcc-3.0.3.tar.gz</a>, is for
   use with GCC 3.0.3+.  In either case, the build instructions (see the
   README after downloading and unpacking) are unchanged.
</p>

<p>If you are using GCC 3.0.[012], then the libstdc++-v3 which ships with 
   that compiler should be used.  It is stable and backwards-compatible.
   With 3.0.3, you can use the stable (shipped) version, or you can download
   the one above.
</p>

<p><strong>Attention!</strong> The library snapshot for GCC 3.0.3 above is
   not the usual 3.0-branch library.  It is a modified version of the current
   development library, slightly altered to work with the 3.0.3+ series of
   compilers.  There are serious differences between the default 3.0.x
   library, and the one above.  Lots of bugfixes, lots of improvements, but
   many changes.
</p>
<p>If you are looking for a stable compiler along with a more cutting-edge
   library, then the replacement library is for you.  If you value stability
   more than radical bugfixes, then stick with the default 3.0.3 setup,
   including its default libstdc++-v3.  If you want major changes everywhere,
   then just use the CVS compiler.  :-)
</p>
<hr>

<p>Compiling this library requires sources of a recent version of GCC.
   We suggest using CVS GCC.  The latest library snapshot has also been
   tested with this recent GCC snapshot:  <strong>2002-01-28</strong>,
   which is available from a
   <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html">GCC mirror site</a> under the
   snapshots directory as &quot;2002-01-28/gcc[-g++]-20020128.tar.gz&quot;,
   or via CVS using the &quot;gcc_ss_20020128&quot; checkout tag.
</p>

<p>The most recent version of this library that will build with
   <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/gcc-2.95.2.html">GCC 2.95.2</a>
   is the ninth snapshot release,
   <a href="download.html">libstdc++-2.90.8.tar.gz</a>.
</p>

<p>If you are using
   <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-2.95/gcc-2.95.3.html">GCC 2.95.3</a>,
   then the most recent usable version of this library is <em>still</em>
   the ninth snapshot release,
   <a href="download.html">libstdc++-2.90.8.tar.gz</a>, <em>and</em> you
   will need to apply
   <a href="libstdc++-2.90.8-compat-gcc-2.95.3.diff">this patch</a> to
   mirror the changes made in gcc/glibc.
</p>

<p>New things that work are in the latest
   <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/17_intro/RELEASE-NOTES">release notes</a>.
</p>

<p>Known problems and bugs, which will force us to actually keep this
   file up-to-date, can be found in <A
   HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/17_intro/BUGS">bugs</a>.
