   Many people contribute to the libstdc++-v3 project,
   and in many different capacities.  Any omissions -- and there probably
   are many --
   in this list are accidental.  <strong>Feel free</strong> to contact
   <a href="mailto:pme@gcc.gnu.org">pme@gcc.gnu.org</a>
   if you have been left out or some of your contributions are not listed.
   Please keep this list in alphabetical order.

<ul>

  <li>J. David Anglin for threading-related fixes and improvements.

  <li>Paolo Carlini for lots of efficiency improvements to the string class,
      and keeping up with the PR reports.

  <li>Michael Cook for cleanup patches to reduce warnings.

  <li>Russell Davidson for fstream and stringstream fixes.

  <li>Gabriel Dos Reis for contributing the valarray implementation,
      taming g++ diagnostic messages involving templates, maintaining
      the numerics library (including that pesky &lt;limits&gt; :-), and
      keeping up-to-date anything to do with numbers.

  <li>Ulrich Drepper for all kinds of C interface issues, contributing
      and maintaining complex&lt;&gt;, sanity checking and disbursement, 
      configuration architecture, libio maintenance, early math work.

  <li>David Edelsohn for doing the entire AIX port with his bare hands.

  <li>Kevin Ediger for the floating point formatting of num_put::do_put.

  <li>Phil Edwards for configuration hackery, documentation maintainer,
      chief breaker of the web pages, and the occasional iostream bugfix.

  <li>Mark Elbrecht for configuration support for locales and
      fstream-related fixes.

  <li>Vadim Egorov for fixes in strings, streambufs, and iostreams.

  <li>Nicolai Josuttis for additional documentation.

  <li>Ryszard Kabatek for many, many bugfixes and optimizations of strings,
      especially member functions, and for auto_ptr fixes.

  <li>Brendan Kehoe for a lot of early work in just about every part of
      the library.

  <li>Mumit Khan for massive porting work to Cygwin/Mingw32.

  <li>Benjamin Kosnik for, well, everything.

  <li>Martin v. Loewis for namespace patches and fixes, and tons of
      assistance with the compiler merges.

  <li>Philip Martin for lots of string and vector iterator fixes and
      improvements, and string clean up and testsuites.

  <li>Alfred Minarik for string and ios bugfixes, and turning the entire
      testsuite namespace-compatible.

  <li>Jason Molenda for keeping all the machines running.  Doing all
      this work on scrap paper and the backs of envelopes would have
      been... difficult.

  <li>Nathan Myers for architecture and authorship through the first 
       three snapshots, including implementation of locale infrastructure, 
       string, shadow C headers, and the initial project documentation 
       (DESIGN, CHECKLIST, and so forth).  Later, more work on MT-safe 
       string and shadow headers.

  <li>Felix Natter for documentation on porting.

  <li>Alexandre Oliva for keeping libtool issues sane and happy.

  <li>Gerald &quot;Jerry&quot; Pfeifer for lots of help on merging with
      the main GCC project.

  <li>Loren James Rittle for threading fixes, thread-related configury
      changes, critical threading documentation, and solutions to really
      tricky I/O problems.

  <li>Chip Salzenberg for patches and improvements to locales, traits,
      Makefiles, libio, libtool hackery, and &quot;long long&quot; support.

  <li>Peter Schmid for constant testing -- especially application testing,
      going above and beyond what was requested for the release criteria
      -- and header file tweaks.

  <li>Kenny Simpson for prompting fixes due to defect reports from the
      LWG (thereby keeping us in line with updates from the ISO).

  <li>Scott Snyder for queue, iterator, istream, and string fixes and
      testsuite entries.

  <li>Petter Urkedal for CXXFLAGS, math, and algorithms fixes.

  <li>Brent Verner for work with the cshadow files and their associated
      configure steps.

  <li>Stephen M. Webb for time and effort on making shadow files work
      with the tricky Solaris 8+ headers, and for pushing the build-time
      header tree.

</ul></p>

<p>We'd also like to thank the folks who have contributed time and
   energy in testing libstdc++-v3, especially those sending in testsuite
   evaluations and documentation corrections:

<ul>

  <li>David Billinghurst
  <li>David Gilbert
  <li>Levente Farkas 
  <li>J&uuml;rgen Freyh
  <li>James Kanze
  <li>llewelly <!-- Honest, that's the only name in the messages. -->
  <li>George Talbot
  <li>Carlo Wood

</ul></p>

<p>It couldn't be done without you!</p>
