   Many people contribute to the libstdc++-v3 project,
   and in many different capacities.  Any omissions -- and there probably
   are many --
   in this list are accidental.  <B>Feel free</B> to contact <A

<UL>

  <LI>Michael Cook for cleanup patches to reduce warnings.

  <LI>Russell Davidson for fstream and stringstream fixes.

  <LI>Gabriel Dos Reis for contributing the valarray implementation,
      taming g++ diagnostic messages involving templates, maintaining
      the numerics library (including that pesky &lt;limits&gt; :-), and
      keeping up-to-date anything to do with numbers.

  <LI>Ulrich Drepper for all kinds of C interface issues, contributing
      and maintaining complex&lt;&gt;, sanity checking and disbursement, 
      configuration architecture, libio maintenance, early math work.

  <LI>Kevin Ediger for the floating point formatting of num_put::do_put.

  <LI>Phil Edwards for configuration hackery, documentation maintainer,
      chief breaker of the web pages, and the occasional iostream bugfix.

  <LI>Mark Elbrecht for configuration support for locales and
      fstream-related fixes.

  <LI>Vadim Egorov for fixes in strings, streambufs, and iostreams.

  <LI>Nicolai Josuttis for additional documentation.

  <LI>Ryszard Kabatek for many, many bugfixes and optimizations of strings,
      especially member functions, and for auto_ptr fixes.

  <LI>Brendan Kehoe for a lot of early work in just about every part of
      the library.

  <LI>Mumit Khan for massive porting work to Cygwin/Mingw32.

  <LI>Benjamin Kosnik for, well, everything.

  <LI>Martin v. Loewis for namespace patches and fixes, and tons of
      assistance with the compiler merges.

  <LI>Philip Martin for lots of string and vector iterator fixes and
      improvements, and string clean up and testsuites.

  <LI>Alfred Minarik for string and ios bugfixes, and turning the entire
      testsuite namespace-compatible.

  <LI>Jason Molenda for keeping all the machines running.  Doing all
      this work on scrap paper and the backs of envelopes would have
      been... difficult.

  <LI>Nathan Myers for architecture and authorship through the first 
       three snapshots, including implementation of locale infrastructure, 
       string, shadow C headers, and the initial project documentation 
       (DESIGN, CHECKLIST, and so forth).  Later, more work on MT-safe 
       string and shadow headers.

  <LI>Felix Natter for documentation on porting.

  <LI>Chip Salzenberg for patches and improvements to locales, traits,
      Makefiles, libio, libtool hackery, and &quot;long long&quot; support.

  <LI>Scott Snyder for queue, iterator, istream, and string fixes and
      testsuite entries.

  <LI>Petter Urkedal for CXXFLAGS, math, and algorithms fixes.

</UL></P>

<P>We'd also like to thank the folks who have contributed time and
   energy in testing libstdc++-v3, especially those sending in testsuite
   evaluations:

<UL>

  <LI>J&uuml;rgen Freyh
  <LI>llewelly <!-- Honest, that's the only name in the messages. -->
  <LI>Loren James Rittle
  <LI>George Talbot

</UL></P>

<P>It couldn't be done without you!</P>
