<H2><A NAME="1">Making code unaware of the container/array difference</A></H2>
   <P>You're writing some code and can't decide whether to use builtin
      arrays or some kind of container.  There are compelling reasons 
      to use one of the container classes, but you're afraid that you'll
      eventually run into difficulties, change everything back to arrays,
      and then have to change all the code that uses those data types to
      keep up with the change.
   </P>
   <P>If your code makes use of the standard algorithms, this isn't as
      scary as it sounds.  The algorithms don't know, nor care, about
      the kind of &quot;container&quot; on which they work, since the
      algorithms are only given endpoints to work with.  For the container
      classes, these are iterators (usually <TT>begin()</TT> and
      <TT>end()</TT>, but not always).  For builtin arrays, these are
      the address of the first element and the past-the-end element.
      <!-- a good explanation of the past-the-end rules is in order,
           probably a link somewhere
      -->
   </P>
   <P>Some very simple wrapper functions can hide all of that from the
      rest of the code.  For example, a pair of functions called
      <TT>beginof</TT> can be written, one that takes an array, another
      that takes a vector.  The first returns a pointer to the first
      element, and the second returns the vector's <TT>begin()</TT>
      iterator.
   </P>
   <P>The functions should be made template functions, and should also 
      be declared inline.  As pointed out in the comments in the code 
      below, this can lead to <TT>beginof</TT> being optimized out of
      existence, so you pay absolutely nothing in terms of increased
      code size or execution time.
   </P>
   <P>The result is that if all your algorithm calls look like
      <PRE>
   std::transform(beginof(foo), endof(foo), beginof(foo), SomeFunction);</PRE>
      then the type of foo can change from an array of ints to a vector
      of ints to a deque of ints and back again, without ever changing any
      client code.
   </P>
   <P>This author has a collection of such functions, called &quot;*of&quot;
      because they all extend the builtin &quot;sizeof&quot;.  It started
      with some Usenet discussions on a transparent way to find the length
      of an array.  A simplified and much-reduced version for easier
      reading is <A HREF="wrappers_h.txt">given here</A>.
   </P>
   <P>Astute readers will notice two things at once:  first, that the
      container class is still a <TT>vector&lt;T&gt;</TT> instead of a
      more general <TT>Container&lt;T&gt;</TT>.  This would mean that
      three functions for <TT>deque</TT> would have to be added, another
      three for <TT>list</TT>, and so on.  This is due to problems with
      getting template resolution correct; I find it easier just to 
      give the extra three lines and avoid confusion.
   </P>
   <P>Second, the line
      <PRE>
    inline unsigned int lengthof (T (&)[sz]) { return sz; } </PRE>
      looks just weird!  Hint:  unused parameters can be left nameless.

<H2><A NAME="2">Variable-sized bitmasks</A></H2>
   <P>No, you cannot write code of the form
      <!-- Careful, the leading spaces in PRE show up directly. -->
      <PRE>
      #include &lt;bitset&gt;

      void foo (size_t n)
      {
          std::bitset&lt;n&gt;   bits;
          ....
      } </PRE>
      because <TT>n</TT> must be known at compile time.  Your compiler is
      correct; it is not a bug.  That's the way templates work.  (Yes, it
      <EM>is</EM> a feature.)
   </P>
   <P>There are a couple of ways to handle this kind of thing.  Please
      consider all of them before passing judgement.  They include, in
      no particular order:
      <UL>
        <LI>A very large N in <TT>bitset&lt;N&gt;</TT>.
        <LI>A container&lt;bool&gt;.
        <LI>Extremely weird solutions.
      </UL>
   </P>
   <P><B>A very large N in <TT>bitset&lt;N&gt;</TT>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>  It has
      been pointed out a few times in newsgroups that N bits only takes up
      (N/8) bytes on most systems, and division by a factor of eight is pretty
      impressive when speaking of memory.  Half a megabyte given over to a
      bitset (recall that there is zero space overhead for housekeeping info;
      it is known at compile time exactly how large the set is) will hold over
      four million bits.  If you're using those bits as status flags (e.g.,
      &quot;changed&quot;/&quot;unchanged&quot; flags), that's a <EM>lot</EM>
      of state.
   </P>
   <P>You can then keep track of the &quot;maximum bit used&quot; during some
      testing runs on representative data, make note of how many of those bits
      really need to be there, and then reduce N to a smaller number.  Leave
      some extra space, of course.  (If you plan to write code like the 
      incorrect example above, where the bitset is a local variable, then you
      may have to talk your compiler into allowing that much stack space;
      there may be zero spae overhead, but it's all allocated inside the
      object.)
   </P>
   <P><B>A container&lt;bool&gt;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>  The Committee made provision
      for the space savings possible with that (N/8) usage previously mentioned,
      so that you don't have to do wasteful things like
      <TT>Container&lt;char&gt;</TT> or <TT>Container&lt;short int&gt;</TT>.
      Specifically, <TT>vector&lt;bool&gt;</TT> is required to be
      specialized for that space savings.
   </P>
   <P>The problem is that <TT>vector&lt;bool&gt;</TT> doesn't behave like a
      normal vector anymore.  There have been recent journal articles which
      discuss the problems (the ones by Herb Sutter in the May and
      July/August 1999 issues of
      <EM>C++ Report</EM> cover it well).  Future revisions of the ISO C++
      Standard will change the requirement for <TT>vector&lt;bool&gt;</TT>
      specialization.  In the meantime, <TT>deque&lt;bool&gt;</TT> is
      recommended (although its behavior is sane, you probably will not get
      the space savings, but the allocation scheme is different than that
      of vector).
   </P>
   <P><B>Extremely weird solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>  If you have access to
      the compiler and linker at runtime, you can do something insane, like
      figuring out just how many bits you need, then writing a temporary 
      source code file.  That file contains an instantiation of <TT>bitset</TT>
      for the required number of bits, inside some wrapper functions with
      unchanging signatures.  Have your program then call the
      compiler on that file using Position Independant Code, then open the
      newly-created object file and load those wrapper functions.  You'll have
      an instantiation of <TT>bitset&lt;N&gt;</TT> for the exact <TT>N</TT>
      that you need at the time.  Don't forget to delete the temporary files.
      (Yes, this <EM>can</EM> be, and <EM>has been</EM>, done.)
   </P>
   <!-- I wonder if this next paragraph will get me in trouble... -->
   <P>This would be the approach of either a visionary genius or a raving
      lunatic, depending on your programming and management style.  Probably
      the latter.
   </P>
   <P>Which of the above techniques you use, if any, are up to you and your
      intended application.  Some time/space profiling is indicated if it
      really matters (don't just guess).  And, if you manage to do anything
      along the lines of the third category, the author would love to hear
      from you...

<H2><A NAME="3">Containers and multithreading</A></H2>
   <P>This section will mention some of the problems in designing MT
      programs that use Standard containers.  For information on other
      aspects of multithreading (e.g., the library as a whole), see
      the Received Wisdom on Chapter 17.
   </P>
   <P>An excellent page to read when working with templatized containers
      and threads is
      <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL/thread_safety.html">SGI's
      http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL/thread_safety.html</A>.  The
      libstdc++-v3 uses the same definition of thread safety
      when discussing design.  A key point that beginners may miss is the
      fourth major paragraph (&quot;For most clients,&quot;...), pointing
      out that locking must nearly always be done outside the container,
      by client code (that'd be you, not us *grin*).
   </P>
   <P>You didn't read it, did you?  *sigh*  I'm serious, go read the
      SGI page.  It's really good and doesn't take long, and makes most
      of the points that would otherwise have to be made here (and does
      a better job).
   </P>
   <P>That's much better.  Now, the issue of MT has been brought up on
      the libstdc++-v3 mailing list as well as the main GCC mailing list
      several times.  The Chapter 17 HOWTO has some links into the mail
      archives, so you can see what's been thrown around.  The usual
      container (or pseudo-container, depending on how you look at it)
      that people have in mind is <TT>string</TT>, which is one of the
      points where libstdc++ departs from the SGI STL.  As of the
      2.90.8 snapshot, the libstdc++-v3 string class is safe for
      certain kinds of multithreaded access.
   </P>
   <P>For implementing a container which does its own locking, it is
      trivial to (as SGI suggests) provide a wrapper class which obtains
      the lock, performs the container operation, then releases the lock.
      This could be templatized <EM>to a certain extent</EM>, on the
      underlying container and/or a locking mechanism.  Trying to provide
      a catch-all general template solution would probably be more trouble
      than it's worth.
