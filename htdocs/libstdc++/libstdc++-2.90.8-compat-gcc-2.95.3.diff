  One of the changes between glibc 2.1 and 2.2 was the underlying type of
  the streampos typedef.  This necessitated a change in some of the gcc
  include files, and was one of the primary motivations for the 2.95.2 ->
  2.95.3 release.

  The patch here

      http://clisp.cons.org/~haible/gccinclude-glibc-2.2-compat.diff

  (referenced from the gcc platform-specific installation page) takes care
  of the differences for the older libstdc++, since the new implementation
  wasn't distributed with the compiler at that time.

  The 2.90.8 snapshot of libstdc++-v3 is still the most recent one that
  will work with the 2.95.x compiler, but for 2.95.3 you need to apply
  the following patch to the libstdc++-v3 sources before configuring.
  I recommend that after patching, you wait a few seconds and then run
  "touch" on the src/Makefile.in file to insure that the build process
  will not incorrectly believe it is outdated.

  (Only the first hunk is glibc-2.2 related.  The other two hunks fix
  the -Werror problem that was discovered about ten minutes after 2.90.8
  was rolled.)
