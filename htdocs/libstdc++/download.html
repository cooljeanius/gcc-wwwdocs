<H3>Getting the sources by FTP or CVS</H3>

<!-- The <URL:foo> syntax is the standard way of writing such things.  No
     link to the FTP site is given directly, encouraging mirror usage.
-->
<P>Get the snapshot archive via FTP from
   <TT>&lt;URL:ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/libstdc++/&gt;</TT>.
   You will almost certainly need to use one of the 
   <A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/mirrors.html">mirror sites</A>
   due to the extremely heavy load on the main server.
</P>

<P>The master CVS repository for libstdc++-v3 is now a part of the gcc
   repository.  As such, checking out the <TT>gcc</TT> module includes
   the current libstdc++-v3 development sources.  To check out
   libstdc++-v3 only, use <TT>libstdc++-v3</TT> instead of <TT>gcc</TT>
   as the module.
   <UL>
     <LI>Read-only CVS repository is available by anonymous CVS.  Directions 
         are <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/cvs.html">here</A>.  You can also
         use anonymous CVS from one of the mirrors of the CVS repository.
     <LI>Read-write CVS repository is available by authorized CVS via SSH.
         Directions are <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/cvswrite.html">here</A>.

</P>
<P>Once you have the GCC sources checked out over CVS, you can use the
   <TT>contrib/gcc_update</TT> script to retrieve the latest changes, and
   automatically update the timestamps of certain files.  With the
   timestamps updated, you won't need autoconf or the other tools (unless
   you make changes, obviously).
</P>

<P>You can also
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/libstdc++-v3?cvsroot=gcc">browse 
   the CVS repository over the web</A>.
</P>
