   <P> The following is the abstract from the implementation notes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The standard class codecvt attempts to address conversions
between different character encoding schemes. In particular, the
standard attempts to detail conversions between the
implementation-defined wide characters (hereafter referred to as
wchar_t) and the standard type char that is so beloved in classic
&quot;C&quot; (which can now be referred to as narrow characters.)
This document attempts to describe how the GNU libstdc++-v3
implementation deals with the conversion between wide and narrow
characters, and also presents a framework for dealing with the huge
number of other encodings that iconv can convert, including Unicode
and UTF8. Design issues and requirements are addressed, and examples
of correct usage for both the required specializations for wide and
narrow characters and the implementation-provided extended
functionality are given.

   <!-- Jumping directly here from chapter 21. -->
   <P>A very common question on newsgroups and mailing lists is, &quot;How
      do I do &lt;foo&gt; to a character string?" where &lt;foo&gt; is
      a task such as changing all the letters to uppercase, to lowercase,
      testing for digits, etc.  A skilled and conscientious programmer
      will follow the question with another, &quot;And how do I make the
      code portable?&quot;
   </P>
   <P>(Poor innocent programmer, you have no idea the depths of trouble
      you are getting yourself into.  'Twould be best for your sanity if
      you dropped the whole idea and took up basket weaving instead.  No?
      Fine, you asked for it...)
   </P>
   <P>The task of changing the case of a letter or classifying a character
      as numeric, graphical, etc, all depends on the cultural context of the
      program at runtime.  So, first you must take the portability question
      into account.  Once you have localized the program to a particular
      natural language, only then can you perform the specific task.
      Unfortunately, specializing a function for a human language is not
      as simple as declaring
      <TT> extern &quot;Danish&quot; int tolower (int); </TT>.
   </P>
   <P>The C++ code to do all this proceeds in the same way.  First, a locale
      is created.  Then member functions of that locale are called to
      perform minor tasks.  Continuing the example from Chapter 21, we wish
      to use the following convenience functions:
   <PRE>
   namespace std {
     template &lt;class charT&gt;
       charT
       toupper (charT c, const locale&amp; loc) const;
     template &lt;class charT&gt;
       charT
       tolower (charT c, const locale&amp; loc) const;
   }</PRE>
      This function extracts the appropriate &quot;facet&quot; from the
      locale <EM>loc</EM> and calls the appropriate member function of that
      facet, passing <EM>c</EM> as its argument.  The resulting character
      is returned.
   </P>
   <P>For the C/POSIX locale, the results are the same as calling the
      classic C <TT>toupper/tolower</TT> function that was used in previous
      examples.  For other locales, the code should Do The Right Thing.
   </P>
   <P>Of course, these functions take a second argument, and the
      transformation algorithm's operator argument can only take a single
      parameter.  So we write simple wrapper structs to handle that.
   </P>
   <P>The next-to-final version of the code started in Chapter 21 looks like:
      <PRE>
   #include &lt;iterator&gt;    // for back_inserter
   #include &lt;locale&gt;
   #include &lt;string&gt;
   #include &lt;algorithm&gt;
   #include &lt;cctype&gt;      // old &lt;ctype.h&gt;

   struct Toupper
   {
       Toupper (std::locale const&amp; l) : loc(l) {;}
       char operator() (char c)  { return std::toupper(c,loc); }
   private:
       std::locale const&amp; loc;
   };
   
   struct Tolower
   {
       Tolower (std::locale const&amp; l) : loc(l) {;}
       char operator() (char c)  { return std::tolower(c,loc); }
   private:
       std::locale const&amp; loc;
   };
   
   int main ()
   {
      std::string  s ("Some Kind Of Initial Input Goes Here");
      Toupper      up ( std::locale("C") );
      Tolower      down ( std::locale("C") );
   
      // Change everything into upper case
      std::transform (s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(),
                      up
                     );
   
      // Change everything into lower case
      std::transform (s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(),
                      down
                     );
   
      // Change everything back into upper case, but store the
      // result in a different string
      std::string  capital_s;
      std::transform (s.begin(), s.end(), std::back_inserter(capital_s),
                      up
                     );
   }</PRE>
   </P>
   <P>The final version of the code uses <TT>bind2nd</TT> to eliminate
      the wrapper structs, but the resulting code is tricky.  I have not
      shown it here because no compilers currently available to me will
      handle it.
