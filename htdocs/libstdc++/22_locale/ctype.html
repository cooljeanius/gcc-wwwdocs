2. What the standard says
</H2>


<P>
<H2>
3. Problems with &quot;C&quot; ctype : global locales, termination.
</H2>

<P>
For the required specialization codecvt&lt;wchar_t, char, mbstate_t&gt; ,
conversions are made between the internal character set (always UCS4
on GNU/Linux) and whatever the currently selected locale for the
LC_CTYPE category implements.

<P>
<H2>
4. Design
</H2>
The two required specializations are implemented as follows:

<P>
<TT>
ctype&lt;char&gt;
</TT>
<P>
This is simple specialization. Implementing this was a piece of cake.

<P>
<TT>
ctype&lt;wchar_t&gt;
</TT>
<P>
This specialization, by specifying all the template parameters, pretty
much ties the hands of implementors. As such, the implementation is
straightforward, involving mcsrtombs for the conversions between char
to wchar_t and wcsrtombs for conversions between wchar_t and char.

<P>
Neither of these two required specializations deals with Unicode
characters. As such, libstdc++-v3 implements

5.  Examples
</H2>

<pre>
  typedef ctype<char> cctype;
</pre>

More information can be found in the following testcases:
<UL>
<LI> testsuite/22_locale/ctype_char_members.cc 
<LI> testsuite/22_locale/ctype_wchar_t_members.cc 
</UL>

<P>
<H2>
6.  Unresolved Issues
</H2>

<UL>
	<LI> how to deal with the global locale issue?

	<LI> how to deal with different types than char, wchar_t?

	<LI> codecvt/ctype overlap: narrow/widen

	<LI> mask typedef in codecvt_base, argument types in codecvt.
	what is know about this type?

	<LI> why mask* argument in codecvt?
	
	<LI> can this be made (more) generic? is there a simple way to
	straighten out the configure-time mess that is a by-product of
	this class?

	<LI> get the ctype<wchar_t>::mask stuff under control. Need to
	make some kind of static table, and not do lookup evertime
	somebody hits the do_is... functions. Too bad we can't just
	redefine mask for ctype<wchar_t>
	
	<LI> rename abstract base class. See if just smash-overriding
	is a better approach. Clarify, add sanity to naming.
