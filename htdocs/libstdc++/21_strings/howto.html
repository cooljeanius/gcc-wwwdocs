<H2><A NAME="1">MFC's CString</A></H2>
   <P>A common lament seen in various newsgroups deals with the Standard
      string class as opposed to the Microsoft Foundation Class called
      CString.  Often programmers realize that a standard portable
      answer is better than a proprietary nonportable one, but in porting
      their application from a Win32 platform, they discover that they
      are relying on special functons offered by the CString class.
   </P>
   <P>Things are not as bad as they seem.  In
      <A HREF="http://egcs.cygnus.com/ml/egcs/1999-04/msg00233.html">this
      message</A>, Joe Buck points out a few very important things:
      <UL>
         <LI>The Standard <TT>string</TT> supports all the operations
             that CString does, with three exceptions.
         <LI>Two of those exceptions (whitespace trimming and case 
             conversion) are trivial to implement.  In fact, we do so
             on this page.
         <LI>The third is <TT>CString::Format</TT>, which allows formatting
             in the style of <TT>sprintf</TT>.  This deserves some mention:
      </UL>
   </P>
   <A NAME="1.1internal"> <!-- Coming from Chapter 27 -->
   <P>The old libg++ library had a function called form(), which did much
      the same thing.  But for a Standard solution, you should use the
      stringstream classes.  These are the bridge between the iostream
      hierarchy and the string class, and they operate with regular
      streams seamlessly because they inherit from the iostream
      heirarchy.  An quick example:
      <PRE>
   #include &lt;iostream&gt;
   #include &lt;string&gt;
   #include &lt;sstream&gt;

   string f (string& incoming)     // incoming is something like "foo  N"
   {
       istringstream   incoming_stream(incoming);
       string          the_word;
       int             the_number;

       incoming_stream &gt;&gt; the_word        // extract "foo"
                       &gt;&gt; the_number;     // extract N

       ostringstream   output_stream;
       output_stream &lt;&lt; "The word was " &lt;&lt; the_word
                     &lt;&lt; " and 3*N was " &lt;&lt; (3*the_number);

       return output_stream.str();
   } </PRE>
   </P></A>
   <P>A serious problem with CString is a design bug in its memory
      allocation.  Specifically, quoting from that same message:
      <PRE>
   CString suffers from a common programming error that results in
   poor performance.  Consider the following code:
   
   CString n_copies_of (const CString& foo, unsigned n)
   {
           CString tmp;
           for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
                   tmp += foo;
           return tmp;
   }
   
   This function is O(n^2), not O(n).  The reason is that each +=
   causes a reallocation and copy of the existing string.  Microsoft
   applications are full of this kind of thing (quadratic performance
   on tasks that can be done in linear time) -- on the other hand,
   we should be thankful, as it's created such a big market for high-end
   ix86 hardware. :-)
   
   If you replace CString with string in the above function, the
   performance is O(n).
      </PRE>
   </P>
   <P>Joe Buck also pointed out some other things to keep in mind when
      comparing CString and the Standard string class:
      <UL>
         <LI>CString permits access to its internal representation; coders
             who exploited that may have problems moving to <TT>string</TT>.
         <LI>Microsoft ships the source to CString (in the files
             MFC\SRC\Str{core,ex}.cpp), so you could fix the allocation
             bug and rebuild your MFC libraries.
             <EM><B>Note:</B>  It looks like the the CString shipped with
             VC++6.0 has fixed this, although it may in fact have been one
             of the VC++ SPs that did it.</EM>
         <LI><TT>string</TT> operations like this have O(n) complexity
             <EM>if the implementors do it correctly</EM>.  The libstdc++
             implementors did it correctly.  Other vendors might not.
         <LI>While parts of the SGI STL are used in libstdc++-v3, their
             string class is not.  The SGI <TT>string</TT> is essentially
             <TT>vector&lt;char&gt;</TT> and does not do any reference
             counting like libstdc++-v3's does.  (It is O(n), though.)
             So if you're thinking about SGI's string or rope classes,
             you're now looking at four possibilities:  CString, the
             libstdc++ string, the SGI string, and the SGI rope, and this
             is all before any allocator or traits customizations!  (More
             choices than you can shake a stick at -- want fries with that?)

<H2><A NAME="2">A case-insensitive string class</A></H2>
   <P>The well-known-and-if-it-isn't-well-known-it-ought-to-be
      <A HREF="http://www.peerdirect.com/resources/">Guru of the Week</A>
      discussions held on Usenet covered this topic in January of 1998.
      Briefly, the challenge was, &quot;write a 'ci_string' class which
      is identical to the standard 'string' class, but is
      case-insensitive in the same way as the (common but nonstandard)
      C function stricmp():&quot;
      <PRE>
   ci_string s( "AbCdE" );

   // case insensitive
   assert( s == "abcde" );
   assert( s == "ABCDE" );

   // still case-preserving, of course
   assert( strcmp( s.c_str(), "AbCdE" ) == 0 );
   assert( strcmp( s.c_str(), "abcde" ) != 0 ); </PRE>
   </P>

   <P>The solution is surprisingly easy.  The original answer pages
      on the GotW website have been removed into cold storage, in
      preparation for a published book of GotW notes.  Before being
      put on the web, of course, it was posted on Usenet, and that
      posting containing the answer is <A HREF="gotw29a.txt">available
      here</A>.

<H2><A NAME="3">Breaking a C++ string into tokens</A></H2>
   <P>The Standard C (and C++) function <TT>strtok()</TT> leaves a lot to
      be desired in terms of user-friendliness.  It's unintuitive, it
      destroys the character string on which it operates, and it requires
      you to handle all the memory problems.  But it does let the client
      code decide what to use to break the string into pieces; it allows
      you to choose the &quot;whitespace,&quot; so to speak.
   </P>
   <P>A C++ implementation lets us keep the good things and fix those
      annoyances.  The implementation here is more intuitive (you only
      call it once, not in a loop with varying argument), it does not
      affect the original string at all, and all the memory allocation
      is handled for you.
   </P>
   <P>It's called stringtok, and it's a template function.  It's given
      <A HREF="stringtok_h.txt">in this file</A> in a less-portable form than
      it could be, to keep this example simple (for example, see the
      comments on what kind of string it will accept).  The author uses
      a more general (but less readable) form of it for parsing command
      strings and the like.  If you compiled and ran this code using it:
      <PRE>
   std::list&lt;string>  ls;
   stringtok (ls, " this  \t is\t\n  a test  ");
   for (std::list&lt;string>::const_iterator i = ls.begin();
        i != ls.end(); ++i)
   {
       std::cerr &lt;&lt; ':' &lt;&lt; (*i) &lt;&lt; ":\n";
   }</PRE>
      You would see this as output:
      <PRE>
   :this:
   :is:
   :a:
   :test:</PRE>
      with all the whitespace removed.  The original <TT>s</TT> is still
      available for use, <TT>ls</TT> will clean up after itself, and
      <TT>ls.size()</TT> will return how many tokens there were.
   </P>
   <P>As always, there is a price paid here, in that stringtok is not
      as fast as strtok.  The other benefits usually outweight that, however.
      <A HREF="stringtok_std_h.txt">Another version of stringtok is given
      here</A>, suggested by Chris King and tweaked by Petr Prikryl,
      and this one uses the
      transformation functions given below.  If you are comfortable with
      reading the new function names, this version is recommended as an example.

<H2><A NAME="4">Simple transformations</A></H2>
   <P>Here are Standard, simple, and portable ways to perform common
      transformations on a <TT>string</TT> instance, such as &quot;convert
      to all upper case.&quot;  The word transformations is especially
      apt, because the standard template function
      <TT>transform&lt;&gt;</TT> is used.
      <PRE>
      #include &lt;string&gt;
      #include &lt;algorithm&gt;
      #include &lt;cctype&gt;      // old &lt;ctype.h&gt;
      std::string  s ("Some Kind Of Initial Input Goes Here");
   
      // Change everything into upper case
      std::transform (s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), toupper);
   
      // Change everything into lower case
      std::transform (s.begin(), s.end(), s.begin(), tolower);
   
      // Change everything back into upper case, but store the
      // result in a different string
      std::string  capital_s;
      capital_s.reserve(s.size());
      std::transform (s.begin(), s.end(), capital_s.begin(), tolower); </PRE>
      <SPAN CLASS="larger"><B>Note</B></SPAN> that these calls all involve
      the global C locale through the use of the C functions
      <TT>toupper/tolower</TT>.  This is absolutely guaranteed to work --
      but only if you're using English text (bummer).  A much better and
      more portable solution is to use a facet for a particular locale
      and call its conversion functions.  (These are discussed more in
      Chapter 22.)
   </P>
   <P>Another common operation is trimming off excess whitespace.  Much
      like transformations, this task is trivial with the use of string's
      <TT>find</TT> family.  These examples are broken into multiple
      statements for readability:
      <PRE>
   std::string  str (" \t blah blah blah    \n ");

   // trim leading whitespace
   string::size_type  notwhite = str.find_first_not_of(" \t\n");
   str.erase(0,notwhite);

   // trim trailing whitespace
   notwhite = str.find_last_not_of(" \t\n"); 
   str.erase(notwhite+1); </PRE>
      Obviously, the calls to <TT>find</TT> could be inserted directly
      into the calls to <TT>erase</TT>, in case your compiler does not
      optimize named temporaries out of existance.
