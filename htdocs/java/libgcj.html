    <h2 align=center>The libgcj home page</h2>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    
    <p>``libgcj'' is the runtime that goes along with the <a
    href="gcj.html">gcj</a> front end to egcs.  libgcj includes parts
    of the Java Class Libraries, plus glue to connect the libraries to
    the compiler and the underlying OS.

    <h2>What you get</h2>

    <p>libgcj eventually builds a couple of libraries (one for the
    runtime and one for the garbage collector), a ``zip'' version of
    the class libraries, and a program called ``jv-convert'' which can
    be used to do character encoding transformations.

    <h2>What is missing?</h2>

    <p>The runtime is not yet fully complete.  Parts of the standard
    class libraries are missing, and some libraries (such as AWT) have
    not even been started.  Also, there is <emph>not</emph> a bytecode
    interpreter; the runtime currently assumes your application will
    be entirely compiled.

    <h2>How to get it</h2>

    <p>The easiest way to get libgcj is to check it out from the
    anonymous cvs repository.  Here's how:
    <pre>
      cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sourceware.cygnus.com:/cvs/java login
        (password is ``anoncvs'')
      cvs -z 3 -d :pserver:anoncvs@sourceware.cygnus.com:/cvs/java co libgcj
    </pre>

    <p>For those without cvs access, you can find libgcj snapshots
    in <a href="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/java/snapshot/">ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/java/snapshot/</a>.


    <h2>How to build it</h2>

    <p>libgcj follows the typical GNU style for configuration and
    building.  You'll need to have gcj built and in your PATH before
    you try to build libgcj.  Once you've done that, the following
    should suffice (note that builds in the source tree probably will
    not work at the current time):

      <pre>
      mkdir build
      cd build
      ../libgcj/configure
      make
      make install
      </pre>

    There are a few options you might consider passing to
    ``configure'':

    <dl>
      <dt>--enable-java-gc=TYPE</dt>
      <dd>Enables the garbage collector.  The default type is
      ``boehm'', for the Boehm conservative GC.  Note that libgcj must
      be configured with the same collector specified when building
      gcj itself.</dd>

      <dt>--enable-fast-character</dt>
      <dd>libgcj includes two implementations of java.lang.Character.
      The default implementation is small, but slow.  This option will
      enable the faster, larger code.</dd>

      <dt>--enable-threads=TYPE</dt>
      <dd>libgcj includes a retargetable thread layer.  The value of
	this option must be the same as the value used when building
	gcj itself.
	By default, no threads will be used (this is a crummy default,
	but we just follow egcs here).
	The only supported values are ``none'' (for no threads) and
	``posix'' (for POSIX threads).</dd>

    </dl>
