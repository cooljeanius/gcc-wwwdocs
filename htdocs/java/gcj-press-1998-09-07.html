<br>A Resource for Distributing, Enhancing, and Fostering Free Open
Sourceware<sup>tm</sup> Technologies


<p>ESC EUROPE, LONDON (September 7, 1998) -- Cygnus Solutions, the market
leader in embedded software development tools, today announced the release
to the Internet of its enhancements to the GNU compiler that support
the Java programming language.  Cygnus' GNU Compiler Java Edition (GCJ)
is an extension to the GNU compiler that allows Java source code and
Java byte codes to be compiled to native instructions.  When combined
with Cygnus' GNUPro Toolkit, GCJ allows developers to write embedded
systems applications in the Java programming language using any of the
more than 125 host/target combinations that Cygnus currently supports.
This is the first release of Cygnus' Java technologies in source form
to the Internet, a move that demonstrates Cygnus' commitment to its
Open Sourceware initiative  the company philosophy that software
infrastructure technologies should be freely available.

<p>As part of this commitment, Cygnus is making
the GCJ sources available through the launch of <a
href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/">sourceware.cygnus.com</a>, an online
resource for software developers around the world. Cygnus' Open Sourceware
technologies such as EGCS compilers, CYGWIN32 cross platform porting
tools, and now GCJ, are available on this web site.  Sourceware.cygnus.com
is intended to be the premier resource for embedded developers wanting to
access, contribute to, or solicit feedback concerning Cygnus-sponsored and
other Internet-based open source projects.  Underscoring the company's
Open Sourceware policy, Cygnus is delivering these compiler extensions
free of charge to the software development community.  The compiler
extensions form the Open Sourceware infrastructure for high performance
and cost effective Java solutions in a wide range of applications.

<p>Cygnus leads the Open Sourceware initiative by hosting the software
distributions on the Cygnus web site, providing engineering leadership
and moderation to the Internet development, and encouraging the free
and open exchange of contributions and usage throughout the software
development community worldwide.

<h3>Software Infrastructure Flourishes with Cygnus Open Sourceware</h3>

<p>"Open Sourceware" is a collection of free software infrastructure
technologies that provide a common level of functionality to benefit
developers, commercial entities, and end users worldwide.  Cygnus is
committed to enabling innovation in the software market at large,
and believes that in order for infrastructure to flourish it cannot be
controlled by a single, proprietary vendor.  Cygnus' Open Sourceware
initiative is intended to establish open, industry-wide standards in the
software development marketplace.  "Today, Cygnus consistently delivers
thousands of hours of engineering research and development back to the
Internet community in order to maintain and grow the GNU infrastructure,"
said Scott Petry, vice president of marketing, Cygnus Solutions.

<p>"We will continue to leverage the Internet-based software development
community to ensure that these open standards are adopted industry-wide.
And Cygnus will continue to work with semiconductor partners and customers
to ensure that these open standard technologies are also the most powerful
resources available for commercial development."

<h3>About Cygnus' GNU Compiler Java Edition</h3>

<p>Cygnus GCJ technology was developed using the Cygnus GNUPro framework
and allows Java source code and byte codes to be compiled to native code.
GCJ-compiled applications, when running native, are not subject to
many of the performance and memory management challenges that embedded
developers face when using the interpreted or just-in-time models.
GCJ is the first release by Cygnus.  Over time, more components will
be released through the sourceware.cygnus.com web site.  Cygnus will
demonstrate the performance of the Cygnus Java Compiler technology --
which is ten times faster than an interpreted application -- at the
Embedded Systems Conference Europe Show in London, Sept 7-9, 1998.


<h3>Cygnus Support for the Java Language</h3>

<p>Cygnus' plans to update its GNUPro compiler will enable the same
high-performance compilation of the Java language as offered for C/C++
and Embedded C++. Cygnus will modify the GNUPro toolchain to provide a
complete Java language compiler, a source- and assembly-level virtual
machine aware debugger, a macro-assembler, linker/loader, libraries,
and binary utilities.  Cygnus' technological innovations with GNUPro for
the Java language provide embedded software developers these advantages:

<ul>
<li>Speed - Code compiled with Cygnus' GCJ is proven to be up to
ten times faster than the traditional interpreted implementations.

<li>Faster time to market - By using the open standard GNUPro
compiler, Cygnus can offer faster time-to-market options as a result of
rapid ports to new host/target combinations.

<li>Flexibility - Cygnus' GCJ is a clean room implementation of a Java
language compiler that provides developers the flexibility to migrate from
C/C++ to the Java programming language, and to mix and match appropriate
source code based on integration and interoperability requirements.

</ul>

<h3>Pricing and availability</h3>

<p>Cygnus Java Compiler is immediately and freely available to software
developers as a technology preview at www.sourceware.cygnus.com.
