It is now possible to call methods on Java interface references from C++ code
via <A HREF="papers/cni/t1.html">CNI</A>, thanks to Bryce McKinlay's compiler
work. <A HREF=http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2001-03/msg01483.html>Details.</A>

Kevin B. Hendricks implemented the necessary FFI support to get the 
libgcj interpreter running on PowerPC. This is now one of our fully supported 
targets!

The first snapshot from the code branch that will become GCC 3.0 is 
now available. Snapshots from this branch will be made weekly. These
include everything you need to build and run GCJ, and should be much
more stable than the main development tree -- so try them out and help us
find bugs!

Made use of Warren Levy's change to the
<A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/mauve/">Mauve test suite</A> to handle
regressions.
Modifications have been made to <tt>mauve.exp</tt> to copy the newly created
<tt>xfails</tt> file of known library failures from the source tree
to the directory where the libjava <tt>'make check'</tt> is being run.  
This allows the testsuite to ignore <tt>XFAIL</tt>s and thus highlight
true regressions in the library.  The Mauve tests are
<a href="test.html">automatically run</a> as part of a libjava
<TT>'make check'</TT> as long as the Mauve suite is accessible
and the env var <TT>MAUVEDIR</TT> is set to point to the top-level
of the <A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/mauve/download.html">Mauve source</A>.

The various gcj mailing lists have moved to gcc.gnu.org.
Unused lists have been removed, and java-discuss was renamed
to java.  See <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java/2001-01/msg00539.html">the announcement</a>
for all the gory details.  With this change, the gcj project
is now fully merged into GCC.

Warren Levy has checked in code for a serialized object dumper.
It is enabled by configuring with <code>--enable-libgcj-debug</code>
and calling <code>System.setProperty("gcj.dumpobjects", "true");</code>
in your test program.
The output will be generated as the object is deserialized (i.e. the
<code>readObject()</code> method is executed).

Bryce McKinlay checked in a large patch merging parts of the Java
Collections code from Classpath into libgcj.  He's also been working
on reformatting code to fit the coding standards, and tuning the
Collections code for performance.
</td></tr>

<b>October 27, 2000</b>

Warren Levy has checked in even more serialization work -- he's been
working steadily on making object serialization compatible with Sun's
implementation for a while now, and I believe we are quite close to
complete compatibility.

also been working on AWT.

Bryce McKinlay checked in a patch that enables bitmap-descriptor based 
marking in the garbage collector. This code includes work by
Tom Tromey and Hans Boehm, and results in some significant

performance gains</A> in memory-intensive code.

<tr><td valign="top">
<b>September 8, 2000</b>

Warren Levy checked in various patches that provide much a more compatible
serialization implementation.  Still some special case classes to go, but
90% of the serializable classes should now be compatible with Sun's JDK.

<b>September 6, 2000</b>

Anthony Green checked in a patch to make gcj read compressed zip
files.  He also moved zlib into the gcc tree -- the first concrete
work towards merging the gcc and libgcj source trees.

We haven't had any news in a while, but things have still been
happening: Anthony Green recently merged in a lot of Classpath code,
in particular the <code>java.util.jar</code> and
<code>java.security.cert</code> packages.  Also, Bryce McKinlay and Rolf
Rasmussen have done a fair amount of work on <code>java.awt</code> (not
ready for a screen shot yet, though).

Oskar Liljeblad has made the first release of

gcj.

<li> Substantial work for the IA-64 port.
<li> <code>java.beans</code> from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">Classpath</a>.
<li> A somewhat modified initial implementation of serialization.

<li> Miscellaneous bug fixes.

Tom Tromey checked in the JNI stubs patch for gcj.  This patch makes

Warren Levy checked in a JDK 1.1 compatible version of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">Classpath's</a> <code>java.sql</code>.
Once we have merged the necessary JDK 1.2 support, we'll update
this to directly track Classpath.

support for most JDK 1.1 language features, such as inner classes.

Warren Levy checked in the basics of the <code>java.security.*</code> packages
that he and Tom Tromey have been putting together.  It is just the basics
of <code>java.security</code> and some of it is indeed stubbed.  It has been
tried with the 20000120 snapshot of 
<a href="http://www.cryptix.org/products/jce/">Cryptix JCE</a>
so it is usable.

Please note that it is mostly JDK 1.1 based but there are some JDK 1.2
things included.

<tr><td valign="top">
<b>March 7, 2000</b>
</td><td>
Bryce McKinlay checked in a change to both the runtime and the
compiler which implements constant-time interface method lookup
and type checking.  This should provide a huge speed increase
for programs that use interfaces or things like ``instanceof''.
</td></tr>

<b>March 6, 2000</b>
</td><td>
We are relicensing libgcj to a more liberal license, and we're
assigning copyright to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">FSF</a>.
This will let us share code with the
<a href="http://www.classpath.org">Classpath</a> project.

Tom Tromey changed g++ to allow CNI code to catch and throw exceptions
Java-style.  This makes it much easier to write CNI code which calls
Java methods that throw exceptions.
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
<b>February 25, 2000</b>

Anthony Green added an important optimization to gcj.  His
optimization eliminates redundant class initializations in some cases.
It should speed up code which uses static methods or fields.
</td></tr>

Hans Boehm has contributed an IA-64 libffi port.  This is an important
step towards getting libgcj to run on the IA-64.

We've done a lot since the previous announcement, but we haven't
mentioned it here.  Oops!  Here are some of the things we've added:
complete reflection support, Runtime.loadLibrary,
Throwable.printStackTrace (this one is <em>very</em> cool),
a Java implementation of java.math.BigInteger, JNI (believed complete
but still in testing), and, of course, many
bug fixes and more minor enhancements.
