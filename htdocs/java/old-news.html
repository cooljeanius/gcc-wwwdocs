We haven't had any news in a while, but things have still been
happening: Anthony Green recently merged in a lot of Classpath code,
in particular the <tt>java.util.jar</tt> and
<tt>java.security.cert</tt> packages.  Also, Bryce McKinlay and Rolf
Rasmussen have done a fair amount of work on <tt>java.awt</tt> (not
ready for a screen shot yet, though).

Oskar Liljeblad has made the first release of
<a href="http://gnome-gcj.sourceforge.net">gnome-gcj</a>.  This is a
project to create a complete set of <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">Gtk+</a>
and <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">Gnome</a> bindings for Java using
gcj.

Today we merged some major work done at Red Hat.  This included:
<ul>
<li> Substantial work for the IA-64 port.
<li> <tt>java.beans</tt> from <a href="http://www.classpath.org">Classpath</a>.
<li> A somewhat modified initial implementation of serialization.
     (This is known not to interoperate with other implementations yet.)
<li> Miscellaneous bug fixes.

Tom Tromey checked in the JNI stubs patch for gcj.  This patch makes
it possible to use compiled Java code where the native methods are
implemented using JNI.

Warren Levy checked in a JDK 1.1 compatible version of
<a href="http://www.classpath.org">Classpath's</a> <tt>java.sql</tt>.
Once we have merged the necessary JDK 1.2 support, we'll update
this to directly track Classpath.

Anthony Green made

of gcj and libgcj.  See his original
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/ml/java/2000-04/msg00022.html">message</a> for some caveats.

Warren Levy checked in the basics of the <tt>java.security.*</tt> packages
that he and Tom Tromey have been putting together.  It is just the basics
of <tt>java.security</tt> and some of it is indeed stubbed.  It has been
tried with the 20000120 snapshot of 
<a href="http://www.cryptix.org/products/jce">Cryptix JCE</a>
so it is usable.

Please note that it is mostly JDK 1.1 based but there are some JDK 1.2
things included.

Bryce McKinlay checked in a change to both the runtime and the
compiler which implements constant-time interface method lookup
and type checking.  This should provide a huge speed increase
for programs that use interfaces or things like ``instanceof''.

We are relicensing libgcj to a more liberal license, and we're
assigning copyright to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">FSF</a>.
This will let us share code with the
<a href="http://www.classpath.org">Classpath</a> project.

Tom Tromey changed g++ to allow CNI code to catch and throw exceptions
Java-style.  This makes it much easier to write CNI code which calls
Java methods that throw exceptions.

Anthony Green added an important optimization to gcj.  His
optimization eliminates redundant class initializations in some cases.
It should speed up code which uses static methods or fields.

We've done a lot since the previous announcement, but we haven't
mentioned it here.  Oops!  Here are some of the things we've added:
complete reflection support, Runtime.loadLibrary,
Throwable.printStackTrace (this one is <emph>very</emph> cool),
a Java implementation of java.math.BigInteger, JNI (believed complete
but still in testing), and, of course, many
bug fixes and more minor enhancements.
