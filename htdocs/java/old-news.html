Hans Boehm contributed a port of libgcj to the IA-64.  This port
includes the interpreter.

Alexandre Petit-Bianco has checked in a change to the compiler to add 
support for most JDK 1.1 language features, such as inner classes.

Warren Levy checked in the basics of the <tt>java.security.*</tt> packages
that he and Tom Tromey have been putting together.  It is just the basics
of <tt>java.security</tt> and some of it is indeed stubbed.  It has been
tried with the 20000120 snapshot of 
<a href="http://www.cryptix.org/products/jce">Cryptix JCE</a>
so it is usable.

Please note that it is mostly JDK 1.1 based but there are some JDK 1.2
things included.

Bryce McKinlay checked in a change to both the runtime and the
compiler which implements constant-time interface method lookup
and type checking.  This should provide a huge speed increase
for programs that use interfaces or things like ``instanceof''.

<b>March 6, 2000</b>
</td><td>
We are relicensing libgcj to a more liberal license, and we're
assigning copyright to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">FSF</a>.
This will let us share code with the
<a href="http://www.classpath.org">Classpath</a> project.

Tom Tromey changed g++ to allow CNI code to catch and throw exceptions
Java-style.  This makes it much easier to write CNI code which calls
Java methods that throw exceptions.

Anthony Green added an important optimization to gcj.  His
optimization eliminates redundant class initializations in some cases.
It should speed up code which uses static methods or fields.

Hans Boehm has contributed an IA-64 libffi port.  This is an important
step towards getting libgcj to run on the IA-64.

We've done a lot since the previous announcement, but we haven't
mentioned it here.  Oops!  Here are some of the things we've added:
complete reflection support, Runtime.loadLibrary,
Throwable.printStackTrace (this one is <emph>very</emph> cool),
a Java implementation of java.math.BigInteger, JNI (believed complete
but still in testing), and, of course, many
bug fixes and more minor enhancements.
