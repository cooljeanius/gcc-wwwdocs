      <h1>Done with GCJ</h1>

      This page provides descriptions and links on projects
      that are using the GCJ runtime and compiler. If you would like
      your project to be listed here or know about a particular
      project, please write to the <a
      href="mailto:java@gcc.gnu.org">list</a>.

        an ActiveX control.

	    20,000 lines of code, all of which compiles nicely into native 
	    code using GCJ.

	    portability.  And, since the simulator is not implemented
	    in C++, it wasn't expected to see major benefits from CNI...

	    The tested configuration relies on Kaffe as equipped
