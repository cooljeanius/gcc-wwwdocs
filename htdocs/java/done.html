      <p>This page provides descriptions and links on projects
      that are using the GCJ runtime and compiler. If you would like
      your project to be listed here or know about a particular
      project, please write to the <a

	what you'll like. iRATE uses GCJ together with the SWT toolkit to provide 
	native binaries on multiple platforms, including Windows and GNU/Linux. 
	iRATE has thousands of users, many of which use iRATE daily, making it 
	perhaps the most widely distributed GCJ-compiled program to date.

        host's graphic routines and can be turned into, for example,
        an ActiveX control.
