<b>January 28, 2001</b>

The various gcj mailing lists have moved to gcc.gnu.org.
Unused lists have been removed, and java-discuss was renamed
to java.  See <a href="/ml/java/2001-01/msg00539.html">the announcement</a>
for all the gory details.  With this change, the gcj project
is now fully merged into GCC.

The Java Gnats database has been merged into the gcc Gnats database.
The old database continues to exist but only for reference purposes;
it is now read-only.

Thanks to Richard Henderson's recent libffi changes, the libgcj bytecode interpreter is now enabled for Alpha systems.

The libgcj sources have <A HREF="/ml/java/2000-12/msg00102.html">

Warren Levy has checked in code for a serialized object dumper.
It is enabled by configuring with <tt>--enable-libgcj-debug</tt>
and calling <tt>java.io.ObjectInputStream.setDump(true);</tt>
in your test program.
The output will be generated as the object is deserialized (i.e. the
<tt>readObject()</tt> method is executed).

Bryce McKinlay checked in a large patch merging parts of the Java
Collections code from Classpath into libgcj.  He's also been working
on reformatting code to fit the coding standards, and tuning the
Collections code for performance.
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
<b>October 27, 2000</b>

Warren Levy has checked in even more serialization work -- he's been
working steadily on making object serialization compatible with Sun's
implementation for a while now, and I believe we are quite close to
complete compatibility.
</td></tr>

<b>October 22, 2000</b>

Rolf Rasmussen has checked in a large piece of code implementing most
of Xlib-based AWT peers as well as parts of J2D.  Bryce McKinlay has
also been working on AWT.

<tr><td valign="top">
<b>September 30, 2000</b>

Bryce McKinlay checked in a patch that enables bitmap-descriptor based 
marking in the garbage collector. This code includes work by
Tom Tromey and Hans Boehm, and results in some significant

performance gains</A> in memory-intensive code.
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
<b>September 8, 2000</b>

Warren Levy checked in various patches that provide much a more compatible
serialization implementation.  Still some special case classes to go, but
90% of the serializable classes should now be compatible with Sun's JDK.
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign="top">
<b>September 6, 2000</b>

Anthony Green checked in a patch to make gcj read compressed zip
files.  He also moved zlib into the gcc tree -- the first concrete
work towards merging the gcc and libgcj source trees.

 What is GCJ?
 </th>
</tr>
</table>
GCJ is a portable, optimizing, ahead-of-time compiler for the Java
Programming Language.  It can compile...
<ul>
<li>Java source code to native machine code,
<li>Java source code to Java bytecode (class files),
<li>and Java bytecode to native machine code.
</ul>

Before executing your compiled application, you must link it with
the GCJ runtime, libgcj, which consists of...
<ul>
<li>the core class libraries,
<li>a garbage collector library,
<li>an abstraction over the system threads,
<li>and, optionally, a bytecode interpreter.
</ul>

The addition of the bytecode interpreter means that GCJ compiled
applications can dynamically load and interpret class files, resulting
in mixed compiled/interpreted systems.

<p>

Compiled Java applications are debugged using recent versions of the
GNU debugger, <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/">GDB</a>.
A <a href="gdb.html">short tutorial</a> on using GDB to debug
GCJ-compiled applications is available.

<p>

In addition to regular native programming, GCJ can be configured as a
cross-compiler, suitable for embedded systems programming.
