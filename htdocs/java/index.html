GCJ is a portable, optimizing, ahead-of-time compiler for the Java
Programming Language.  It can compile:
<ul>
<li>Java source code directly to native machine code,
<li>Java source code to Java bytecode (class files),
<li>and Java bytecode to native machine code.
</ul>

Compiled applications are linked with the GCJ runtime, <code>libgcj</code>, 
which provides the core <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">
class libraries</A>, a garbage collector, and a bytecode
interpreter. <code>libgcj</code> can dynamically load and interpret 
class files, resulting in mixed compiled/interpreted applications.

<p>

Most of the APIs specified by "The Java Class Libraries" Second Edition and 
the "Java 2 Platform supplement" are supported, including collections, 
networking, reflection, and serialization. AWT and RMI are currently 
unsupported, but work to implement them is in progress.

<p>

Debugging is supported using recent versions of the
GNU debugger, <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/">GDB</a>.
A <a href="gdb.html">short tutorial</a> on using GDB to debug
GCJ-compiled applications is available.

<p>

In addition to regular native programming, GCJ can be configured as a
cross-compiler, suitable for embedded systems programming.

<p>

GCJ is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (<A HREF="../">GCC</A>). GCC, gdb and related tools are <a

Made use of Warren Levy's change to the Mauve testsuite to handle regressions.
Modifications have been made to <tt>mauve.exp</tt> to copy the newly created
<tt>xfails</tt> file of known library failures from the source tree
to the directory where the libjava <tt>'make check'</tt> is being run.  
This allows the testsuite to ignore <tt>XFAIL</tt>s and thus highlight
true regressions in the library.

The various gcj mailing lists have moved to gcc.gnu.org.
Unused lists have been removed, and java-discuss was renamed
to java.  See <a href="/ml/java/2001-01/msg00539.html">the announcement</a>
for all the gory details.  With this change, the gcj project
is now fully merged into GCC.

The Java Gnats database has been merged into the gcc Gnats database.
The old database continues to exist but only for reference purposes;
it is now read-only.
