<h1>The GNU Compiler for the Java<sup><a href="tm.html"><small>tm</small></a></sup> Programming Language</h1>

<h2>What is GCJ?</h2>

<p>GCJ is a portable, optimizing, ahead-of-time compiler for the Java
Programming Language.  It can compile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java source code directly to native machine code,</li>
<li>Java source code to Java bytecode (class files),</li>
<li>and Java bytecode to native machine code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compiled applications are linked with the GCJ runtime,
<code>libgcj</code>, which provides the core class libraries, a
garbage collector, and a bytecode interpreter. <code>libgcj</code> can
dynamically load and interpret class files, resulting in mixed
compiled/interpreted applications.</p>

<p>
Most of the APIs specified by "The Java Class Libraries" Second
Edition and the "Java 2 Platform supplement" are supported, including
collections, networking, reflection, and serialization. AWT is
currently unsupported, but work to implement it is in progress.
</p>

<p>
Debugging is supported using recent versions of the
GNU debugger, <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/">GDB</a>.
A <a href="gdb.html">short tutorial</a> on using GDB to debug
GCJ-compiled applications is available.
</p>

<p>
In addition to regular native programming, GCJ can be configured as a
cross-compiler, suitable for embedded systems programming.
</p>

<p>
GCJ is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (<a href="../">GCC</a>). GCC, 
GDB and related tools are 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>.  
libgcj is slowly being merged with <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">GNU Classpath</a>.  (You
can see the <a href="libgcj-classpath-compare.html">status of the merge</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Many free software Java packages have been ported to work with GCJ.  A
collection of such packages are in the <a
href="http://sources.redhat.com/rhug/">rhug</a> project.  Both sources
and RPMs are available.
</p>

<p>
For <code>javax.crypto</code> support, we recommend the use of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-crypto/">GNU Crypto</a>.

Thanks to Wes Biggs and the other GNU Regexp authors, Mark Wielaard
(for merging into Classpath) and Anthony Green (for merging into
libgcj), we now have support for <code>java.util.regex</code>.  This
arrives a little too late for gcc 3.4, but it will appear in the next
release.

Graydon Hoare has checked in
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java-patches/2004-q1/msg00241.html">a
patch to implement Swing buttons</a>.  This is the first working Swing code,
a major improvement.  See the <a href="swingshot.png">screen shot</a>.

large reorganization</a> of <code>-findirect-dispatch</code>.  This is
an important step toward the new binary compatibility ABI.

Jeff Sturm has adapted Jan Hubicka's call graph optimization code to gcj.
This code improves gcj's method inlining abilities with support for
out-of-order methods and inter-class method calls, along with improved
code size heuristics.  It is enabled by default when compiling at -O3.

Gary Benson from Red Hat has released 
<a href="http://people.redhat.com/gbenson/naoko/">Naoko</a>: a subset 
of the <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/rhug/">rhug</a> packages 
that have been repackaged for eventual inclusion in Red Hat Linux. 
Naoko basically comprises binary RPMS of Ant, Tomcat, and their 
dependencies built with gcj.

written in Java, that has been compiled with a modified gcj.
You can find more information

Andrew Haley has checked in a major patch to the
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/tree-ssa/">tree-ssa branch</a>
that allows us to convert entire functions to trees when reading
from <code>.class</code> files.  This is an important step towards
better high-level optimizations for Java.
