<br>
GCJ is a portable, optimizing, ahead-of-time compiler for the Java
Programming Language.  It can compile:
<ul>
<li>Java source code directly to native machine code,
<li>Java source code to Java bytecode (class files),
<li>and Java bytecode to native machine code.
</ul>

Compiled applications are linked with the GCJ runtime, <code>libgcj</code>, 
which provides the core <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">
class libraries</A>, a garbage collector, and a bytecode
interpreter. <code>libgcj</code> can dynamically load and interpret 
class files, resulting in mixed compiled/interpreted applications.

<p>

Most of the APIs specified by "The Java Class Libraries" Second Edition and 
the "Java 2 Platform supplement" are supported, including collections, 
networking, reflection, and serialization. AWT and RMI are currently 
unsupported, but work to implement them is in progress.

<p>

Debugging is supported using recent versions of the
GNU debugger, <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/">GDB</a>.
A <a href="gdb.html">short tutorial</a> on using GDB to debug
GCJ-compiled applications is available.

<p>

In addition to regular native programming, GCJ can be configured as a
cross-compiler, suitable for embedded systems programming.

<p>

GCJ is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (<A HREF="../">GCC</A>). GCC, 
GDB and related tools are

Per Bothner of Brainfood Inc has implemented an invocation interface
allowing an existing non-Java thread to start and connect to a Java
environment.  The GCJ start-up code now uses this interface.
Brainfood is using this to attach an Apache module to a pre-compiled
servlet-like class.

We now have a new hash-table based lightweight lock implementation which was 
contributed by Hans Boehm. The new code should reduce memory consumption and 
improve performance for applications which do a lot of synchronization. 
Currently, this code is enabled for IA-64 and X86 Linux.
