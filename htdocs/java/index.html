<h1>The GNU Compiler for the Java<sup><a href="tm.html"><small>tm</small></a></sup> Programming Language</h1>

<h2>What is GCJ?</h2>

<p>GCJ is a portable, optimizing, ahead-of-time compiler for the Java
Programming Language.  It can compile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java source code directly to native machine code,</li>
<li>Java source code to Java bytecode (class files),</li>
<li>and Java bytecode to native machine code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compiled applications are linked with the GCJ runtime,
<code>libgcj</code>, which provides the core class libraries, a
garbage collector, and a bytecode interpreter. <code>libgcj</code> can
dynamically load and interpret class files, resulting in mixed
compiled/interpreted applications.</p>

<p>
Most of the APIs specified by "The Java Class Libraries" Second
Edition and the "Java 2 Platform supplement" are supported, including
collections, networking, reflection, and serialization. AWT is
currently unsupported, but work to implement it is in progress.
</p>

<p>
Debugging is supported using recent versions of the
GNU debugger, <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/">GDB</a>.
A <a href="gdb.html">short tutorial</a> on using GDB to debug
GCJ-compiled applications is available.
</p>

<p>
In addition to regular native programming, GCJ can be configured as a
cross-compiler, suitable for embedded systems programming.
</p>

<p>
GCJ is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (<a href="../">GCC</a>). GCC, 
GDB and related tools are 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>.  
libgcj is slowly being merged with <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">GNU Classpath</a>.  (You
can see the <a href="libgcj-classpath-compare.html">status of the merge</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Many free software Java packages have been ported to work with GCJ.  A
collection of such packages are in the <a
href="http://sources.redhat.com/rhug/">rhug</a> project.  Both sources
and RPMs are available.
</p>

<p>
For <code>javax.crypto</code> support, we recommend the use of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-crypto/">GNU Crypto</a>.

Adam Megacz has contributed a mingw32 port of libgcj.  This port is
still a little bit incomplete (e.g., <code>java.lang.Process</code>
doesn't work), and it currently only works as a target, not a host.
Still, it works, and he is using it for <a
href="http://www.xwt.org/">XWT</a>.  This work will appear in the
upcoming 3.1 release.

Bryce McKinlay has contributed a patch to optimize some of the array
access and added a new compiler flag, <code>--no-store-check</code>,
to disable assignability checks for stores into object arrays. With
code that is known not to throw <code>ArrayStoreException</code>, this
flag can be used to disable the check operations. In which case it can
provide a reasonable performance boost and slight code size reduction.

<tr><td valign="top">
<b>January 22, 2002</b>
</td><td>
Tom Tromey has contributed a patch to allow certain Java method calls
to be inlined by gcj.  For instance, calls to <code>Math.min</code>
are now inlined when optimization is enabled.  This patch includes
some infrastructure to make it easy to add more such inlines when
desired.

<b>January 14, 2002</b>

Richard Stallman has changed the licensing of the Classpath AWT
implementation to match the licensing of the rest of Classpath.  This
means that the only remaining barrier to AWT for libgcj is manpower.
Work has already begun to merge the Classpath and libgcj AWT
implementations.

<b>September 7, 2001</b>
</td><td>
Anthony Green of Red Hat has added a facility for compiling property
files and other system resources into libraries and executables.
These files are accessible to the gcj runtime via the new "core"
protocol handler.  The gcj runtime places "core:/" at the end of the
java.class.path, ensuring that compiled-in resource files are
discovered and loaded when required.  This is a convenient feature for
building and deploying libraries and executables with no external file
dependencies.  See the <code>--resource</code> option in the gcj
manual for details.

Per Bothner of Brainfood Inc has implemented an invocation interface
allowing an existing non-Java thread to start and connect to a Java
environment.  The GCJ start-up code now uses this interface.
Brainfood is using this to attach an Apache module to a pre-compiled
servlet-like class.

<b>May 30, 2001</b>
</td><td>
We now have a new hash-table based lightweight lock implementation which was 
contributed by Hans Boehm. The new code should reduce memory consumption and 
improve performance for applications which do a lot of synchronization. 
Currently, this code is enabled for IA-64 and X86 Linux.
