<br>
GCJ is a portable, optimizing, ahead-of-time compiler for the Java
Programming Language.  It can compile:
<ul>
<li>Java source code directly to native machine code,
<li>Java source code to Java bytecode (class files),
<li>and Java bytecode to native machine code.
</ul>

Compiled applications are linked with the GCJ runtime, <code>libgcj</code>, 
which provides the core <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">
class libraries</A>, a garbage collector, and a bytecode
interpreter. <code>libgcj</code> can dynamically load and interpret 
class files, resulting in mixed compiled/interpreted applications.

<p>

Most of the APIs specified by "The Java Class Libraries" Second Edition and 
the "Java 2 Platform supplement" are supported, including collections, 
networking, reflection, and serialization. AWT and RMI are currently 
unsupported, but work to implement them is in progress.

<p>

Debugging is supported using recent versions of the
GNU debugger, <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gdb/">GDB</a>.
A <a href="gdb.html">short tutorial</a> on using GDB to debug
GCJ-compiled applications is available.

<p>

In addition to regular native programming, GCJ can be configured as a
cross-compiler, suitable for embedded systems programming.

<p>

GCJ is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (<A HREF="../">GCC</A>). GCC, 
GDB and related tools are

Kevin B. Hendricks implemented the neccessary FFI support to get the

The first snapshot from the code branch that will become GCC 3.0 is 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/sourceware/gcc/snapshots/">
now available</A>. Snapshots from this branch will be made weekly. These
include everything you need to build and run GCJ, and should be much
more stable than the main development tree -- so try them out and help us
find bugs!
