 /**
- * Thrown when a thread attempts to wait or notify on a monitor that it

- * <pre>
- * void m() {
- *   notify();
- * }
- * </pre>
+ * Exceptions may be thrown by one part of a Java program and caught
+ * by another in order to deal with exceptional conditions.  
+ * If a thread attempts to wait on an object's monitor then
+ * <code>IllegalMonitorStateException</code> can be thrown.  This
+ * exception is also thrown to give a message to other threads also waiting
+ * on an object's monitor without owning the monitor.
