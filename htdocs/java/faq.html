          <h3><a name="1_7">1.7 Can I interface byte-compiled and native java code</a></h3>
        </dt>
        <p> 
        <dd>
	libgcj has a bytecode interpreter that allows you to mix .class files with
	compiled code. It works pretty transparently: if a compiled version of a class is
	not found in the application binary or linked shared libraries, the class loader
	will search for a bytecode version in your classpath, much like a VM would. Be
	sure to build libgcj with the --enable-interpreter option to enable this
	functionality. Currently this only works on x86 linux. 
        <p>
	<p>The program "gij" provides a front end to the interpreter that behaves
	much like a traditional virtual machine. You can even use "gij" to run a shared library 
	which is compiled from java code and contains a main method:
<pre>
$ gcj -shared -o HelloWorld.so HelloWorld.java
$ gij HelloWorld
</pre>
          This works because gij uses Class.forName, which now knows how to load shared objects.

        <dd> <a href="mailto:mdw@cs.berkeley.edu">Matt Welsh</a> writes:</dd>
        <dl> 
          <dd>Just look in the 'libjava' directory of libgcj and see what classes 
            are there. Most GUI stuff isn't there yet, that's true, but many of 
            the other classes are easy to add if they don't yet exist. </dd>
          <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
          <dd>I think it's important to stress that there is a big difference 
            between Java and the many libraries which Java supports. Unfortunately, 
            Sun's promise of &quot;write once, run everywhere&quot; assumes much 
            more than a JVM: you also need the full set of JDK libraries. Considering 
            that new Java APIs come out every week, it's going to be impossible 
            to track everything. </dd>
          <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
          <dd>To make things worse, you can't simply run Sun's JDK classes on 
            any old JVM -- they assume that a bunch of native methods are also 
            defined. Since this native method requirement isn't defined by the 
            JDK specs, you're effectively constrained to using Sun's JVMs if you 
            want to use Sun's JDK libraries. Oh yes -- you could also reimplement 
            all of those native methods yourself, and make sure they behave exactly 
            as Sun's do. Note that they're undocumented! </dd>

        <blockquote> 
	  <p>Yes. libgcj now has experimental support for JNI, in addition to
	  its native Compiled Native Interface (CNI). gcjh will generate JNI 
	  stubs and headers using the "-jni" option. However, we do 
	  prefer CNI: it is more efficient, easier to write, and (at least 
	  potentially) easier to debug.

        <blockquote> 
          <p><a href="mailto:per@bothner.com">Per Bothner</a> explains </p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>We use CNI because we think it is a better solution, especially 
              for a Java implementation that is based on the idea that Java is 
              just another programming language that can be implemented using 
              standard compilation techniques. Given that, and the idea that languages 
              implemented using Gcc should be compatible where it makes sense, 
              it follows that the Java calling convention should be as similar 
              as practical to that used for other languages, especially C++, since 
              we can think of Java as a subset of C++. CNI is just a set of helper 
              functions and conventions built on the idea that C++ and Java have 
              the *same* calling convention and object layout; they are binary 
              compatible. (This is a simplification, but close enough.)</p>

      <h3><a name="2_4">2.4 What is the state of AWT support</a>?</h3>
      <dl> 
        <dd> No support is currently in place for AWT. Prior Art which could be 
          used for this all require JNI. Possible starting points follow: 
          <dl> </dl>
          <p>QtAWT</p>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>QtAWT ( )provides a Qt based implementation of the peer classes 
              used by the AWT components. This consists of a set of Java classes 
              that implement the interfaces specified in java.awt.peer, and a 
              few others such as java.awt.Toolkit. The classes are implemented 
              in a mixture of Java code and native code, with the native methods 
              being called via the JNI. Because it sticks to standard APIs such 
              as the JNI QtAWT should be portable enough to work on any 1.1 JVM. 
              Once the class and library paths have been set up correctly, the 
              QtAWT can be used instead of the native peers provided with your 
              JVM by setting the awt.toolkit property to point to the QtToolkit

      <h3><a name="2_5">2.5 How about support for Swing</a>?</h3>
      <dl> 
        <dl> 
          <dt>Considering that AWT support isnt here yet there is no chance of 
            getting Swing running. Once we have AWT support the Swing 1.1.1 may 
            be useable and even redistributable, but JFC will be another issue, 
            as <a href="mailto:moroz@metahood.ru">Oleg Moroz</a> summarises: 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>1) Swing 1.1.1 for JDK 1.1.x with license that allows to redistribute 
                it as part of the value-added applet or application. This needs 
                some research, however I feel that the term "value-added application" 
                might include e.g. gcj-based development system; if it is not 
                by itself, a simple Swing-based application might be added to 
                the distribution). This version depends on AWT 1.1 only (well, 
                1.1.x, x >=7) and it seems that the Sun's version could be used 
                for most purposes people would like to use it. </p>
            </blockquote>
          </dt>
          <blockquote> 
            <p>2) Swing (JFC) that is part of Java2. This is AFAIK not available 
              as separate product and is covered by more restrictive (in this 
              case at least) JDK license; it is also dependent on AWT 1.2 features. 
              We'd want to develop a replacement only when we move to the 1.2 
              codebase and then we'll also need to develop AWT 1.2 replacement

            in conjunction with AWT. We can implement JTextArea and TextArea at 
            the same time. We could also implement both on top of (say) some Gtk 
            widget; we don't necessarily *have* to go the "peerless" route. Instead, 
            we can base the "plugable look-and-feel" on the "themebility" of (say) 
            Gtk. </dd>
          <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
          <dd>A bigger potential issue is Swing's separation between &quot;model&quot; 
            (e.g. Document) and &quot;view&quot; (e.g. JTextPane). It may be difficult 
            to make use of the functionality of an existing toolkit such as Gtk 
            unless we can use Gtk widgets with separate &quot;model&quot; objects.</dd>

        </dt>
        <p> 
        <dd>There is a known problem with the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-bugs/1999-10/msg00159.html"> 
          native Solaris linker</a> when using gcc/gcj. A good indication you've 
          run into this problem is if you get an error that looks like the following 
          when building libgcj: 
          <pre>
ld: warning: option -o appears more than once, first setting taken
ld: fatal: file libfoo.so: cannot open file: No such file or directory
ld: fatal: File processing errors. No output written to .libs/libfoo.so
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
	</pre>
          A known workaround for this and other reported link problems on the 
          various releases of Solaris is to build gcc/gcj with the <a href="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/binutils/snapshots"> 
          latest GNU binutils</a> instead of the native Solaris <tt>ld</tt>. The 
          most straightforward way to do this is to build and install binutils, 
          and then reference it in the configure for gcc via <tt>--with-ld=/path_to_binutils_install/bin/ld</tt> 
          (<tt>--with-as</tt> may also be similarly specified but is not believed 
          to be required). 
          <p> Please note, gcc/gcj must be built using GNU ld prior to doing a 
            clean build of libgcj!

      <dl> 
        <dd>The GCJ compiler will compile both java source and bytecode .class 
          files. For the moment support for compiling bytecodes will support more 
          applications than compiling from source, as the source code compiler 
          has some bugs in its support for inner classes, which are used heavily 
	  in programs written for the JDK 1.1 (AWT in particular). 
          <p>In many cases the native code produced by compiling from source is 
            better optimised than that compiled from .class files. Per Bothner 
            explains:</p>
        </dd>
        <dt> 
          <dl> 
            <dd>The reason is that when you compile to bytecode you lose a lot 
              of information about program structure etc. That information helps 
              in generating better code. We can in theory recover the information 
              we need by analysing the structure of the bytecodes, but it is sometimes 
              difficult - or sometimes it just that no-one has gotten around to 
              it. 
              <p>Specific examples include loop structure (gcc generates better 
                code with explicit loops rather than with the equivalent spaghetti 
                code), array initializers, and the JDK 1.1 `CLASS.class' syntax, 
                all of which are represented using more low-level constructs in 
                bytecode.</p>

    There seems to be a bug in the current iconv support. You can work around
    it for now by setting <tt>LANG=en_US.UTF-8</tt> at runtime. Or give the
    following option during compile time <tt>-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8</tt>.

      <h3><a name="6_1"></a>6.1 Are there any examples of how to use CNI?</h3>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Glenn Chambers has created a couple 
          of trivial examples <a href="cni-1.txt">here</a> and <a href="cni-2.txt">here</a>. 
        As a comparision, <a href="jni-kaffe.txt">here</a>
        is the same example as a JNI application.
        </p>
        <p>
        Note that you must compile the C++ files used for CNI with the
        -fno-rtti option.
        </p>
        <p>The primary source of documentation for CNI is at <a href="papers/cni/t1.html">http://sourceware.cygnus.com/java/papers/cni/t1.html</a></p>
