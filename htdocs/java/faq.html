          libgcj is distributed under the GPL, with the 'libgcc exception'.
          This means that linking with libgcj does not by itself cause
          your program to fall under the GPL.  See LIBGCJ_LICENSE in
          the source tree for more details.

          Gcj and libgcj are known to work more or less with IA-32 and 
          SPARC Solaris, Tru64 Unix, as well as IA-32, IA-64, Alpha, and PowerPC 
          Linux. They might work on other systems. Generally speaking, porting to a new 
          system should not be hard. This would be a good way to volunteer.

      <dl> 
        <dd>
          <p>libgcj has a bytecode interpreter that allows you to mix .class files with
          compiled code. It works pretty transparently: if a compiled version of a class is
          not found in the application binary or linked shared libraries, the class loader
          will search for a bytecode version in your classpath, much like a VM would. Be
          sure to build libgcj with the --enable-interpreter option to enable this
          functionality.</p>
        
          <p>The program "gij" provides a front end to the interpreter that behaves
          much like a traditional virtual machine. You can even use "gij" to run a shared library 
          which is compiled from java code and contains a main method:</p>
          <pre>
$ gcj -shared -o lib-HelloWorld.so HelloWorld.java
$ gij HelloWorld
          </pre>
          This works because gij uses Class.forName, which knows how to load shared objects.

          <blockquote>
            <p>Just look in the 'libjava' directory of libgcj and see what classes 
            are there. Most GUI stuff isn't there yet, that's true, but many of 
            the other classes are easy to add if they don't yet exist. </p>

            <p>I think it's important to stress that there is a big difference 
            between Java and the many libraries which Java supports. Unfortunately, 
            Sun's promise of &quot;write once, run everywhere&quot; assumes much 
            more than a JVM: you also need the full set of JDK libraries. Considering 
            that new Java APIs come out every week, it's going to be impossible 
            to track everything. </p>
  
            <p>To make things worse, you can't simply run Sun's JDK classes on 
            any old JVM -- they assume that a bunch of native methods are also 
            defined. Since this native method requirement isn't defined by the 
            JDK specs, you're effectively constrained to using Sun's JVMs if you 
            want to use Sun's JDK libraries. Oh yes -- you could also reimplement 
            all of those native methods yourself, and make sure they behave exactly 
            as Sun's do. Note that they're undocumented! </p>

        <dd>
          Yes. libgcj now has experimental support for JNI, in addition to
          its native Compiled Native Interface (CNI). gcjh will generate JNI 
          stubs and headers using the "-jni" option. However, we do 
          prefer CNI: it is more efficient, easier to write, and (at least 
          potentially) easier to debug.

          <a href="mailto:per@bothner.com">Per Bothner</a> explains:
          <blockquote> 
            <p>We use CNI because we think it is a better solution, especially 
            for a Java implementation that is based on the idea that Java is 
            just another programming language that can be implemented using 
            standard compilation techniques. Given that, and the idea that languages 
            implemented using Gcc should be compatible where it makes sense, 
            it follows that the Java calling convention should be as similar 
            as practical to that used for other languages, especially C++, since 
            we can think of Java as a subset of C++. CNI is just a set of helper 
            functions and conventions built on the idea that C++ and Java have 
            the *same* calling convention and object layout; they are binary 
            compatible. (This is a simplification, but close enough.)</p>

        <dd>
          Work is in progress to implement AWT and Java2D. We 
          intend to support both GTK and xlib peers written using CNI. Some
          components are already working atop the

          Once AWT support is working then Swing support can be considered. There
          is at least one free-software partial implementations of Swing that may 
          be usable.

      <h3><a name="2_6">2.6 </a>What support is there for RMI?</h3>
      <dl> 
        <dd> RMI code exists on the CVS trunk (aka gcc 3.1), but it
              has not been heavily tested.  This code was donated by
              Transvirtual Technologies.

        projects to supplement libgcj's current features?</a></h3>
      <dl> 
        <dd>
          <p>Certainly, provided the licenses are compatible.
          However, in many cases, if you wanted to contribute the 
          code back into the official libgcj distribution, we would require that the 
          original author(s) assign copyright to the Free Software Foundation. </p>
          <p> As of March 6, 2000, libgcj has been relicenced, and copyright has
          been assigned to the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">FSF</a>. This allows 
          us to share and merge much of the libgcj codebase with the 
          <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/">Classpath</a> project. 
          Our eventual goal is for Classpath to be an upstream source provider for libgcj, 
          however it will be some time before this becomes reality: libgcj and Classpath 
          have different implementations of
          many core java classes. In order to merge them, we need to select the 
          best (most efficient, cleanest) implementation of each method/class/package,
          resolve any conflicts created by the merge, and test the final result. 
          Needless to say, this is a lot of work. If you can help out, please

          <p>GCJ will compile both source <code>(.java)</code> and bytecode 
          <code>(.class)</code> files. However, in many cases the native code produced

          <blockquote> 
            <p>The reason is that when you compile to bytecode you lose a lot 
            of information about program structure etc. That information helps 
            in generating better code. We can in theory recover the information 
            we need by analysing the structure of the bytecodes, but it is sometimes 
            difficult - or sometimes it just that no-one has gotten around to 
            it.</p> 
            <p>Specific examples include loop structure (gcc generates better 
            code with explicit loops rather than with the equivalent spaghetti 
            code), array initializers, and the JDK 1.1 `CLASS.class' syntax, 
            all of which are represented using more low-level constructs in

          <p>GCJ compiles only the files presented to it on the command line. However,

          classes and check for errors in your code.      For these dependencies, GCJ will

        <dd>
          This is "normal"; the Garbage Collector (GC) uses it to determine 
          stack boundaries. It is ordinarily caught and handled by the GC -- you 
          can see this in the debugger by using <tt>cont</tt> to continue to the 
          "real" segv.

      <dl> 
        <dd>A few things: 
          <ul>
            <li>If your programs allocate many small, short lived objects, the 
              heap could be filling and triggering GC too regularly. Try increasing 
              the initial and maximum heap sizes as per <i>5.5 How do I increase 
              the runtime's initial and maximum heap size?</i></li>
            <li>RE - array accesses. We have sub-optimal runtime checking code, 
              and the compiler is still not so smart about automatically removing 
              array checks. If your code is ready, and it doesn't rely on them, 
              try compiling with --no-bounds-check. </li>
            <li>Try static linking.  On many platforms, dynamic (PIC) function 
              calls are more expensive than static ones. In particular, the 
              interaction with boehm-gc seems to incur extra overhead when shared 
              libraries are used. </li>
            <li>If your Java application doesn't need threads, try building libgcj 
              using --enable-threads=none. Portions of the libgcj runtime are 
              still more efficient when single-threaded.</li>

        <dd>
          <p>It is possible to turn on verbose GC output by suppressing the -DSILENT 
          flag during build. One way to do this is to comment out the line with 
          #define SILENT 1 from boehm-gc/configure before configuring libgcj. </p>
          <p>The GC will print collection statistics to stdout. (Rebuilding boehm-gc 
          alone without this flag doesn't seem to work.)</p>

          <p>Some programs that allocate many small, short-lived objects can cause

          release there is no means to adjust the heap at runtime. Recent snapshots 
          provide the -ms and -mx arguments to gij to specify the initial and

      <h3><a name="6_1"></a>6.1 Are there any examples of how to use CNI?</h3>
      <dl>
        <dd>
          <p>Glenn Chambers has created a couple 
          of trivial examples for
          <a href="cni-1.txt">version 2.95</a> 
          and <a href="cni-2.txt">version 3.0</a>. 
          As a comparison, <a href="jni-kaffe.txt">here</a>
          is the same example as a JNI application using 
          <a href="http://www.kaffe.org">Kaffe</a>.  The same code will
          work with GCJ, as shown <a href="jni-comp.txt">here</a>.</p>
        
          <p>Note that for version 2.95, you must compile the C++ files 
          used for CNI with the -fno-rtti option.
          This constraint does not apply in version 3.0 and later.</p>
          
          <p>The primary source of documentation for CNI is at <a href="papers/cni/t1.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/java/papers/cni/t1.html</a></p>

          <p>Yes, GCJ 3.1 supports a CNI-based invocation interface as well as 
	  the traditional JNI invocation API.

          See the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcj/Invocation.html">GCJ Manual</a> 
          for more details on how to use the CNI interface. </p>
