<h2><a name="top">Compiling Java for Embedded Systems</a></h2>

<h4>By Per Bothner <a
href="mailto:bothner@cygnus.com">(bothner@cygnus.com)</a></h4>

<font size=2>
While a major factor in Java’s success is
its use of portable bytecodes, we believe it cannot become a
mainstream programming language without mainstream implementation
techniques. Specifically, an optimizing, ahead-of-time compiler allows
much better optimization along with much faster application start-up
times than with JIT translators. Cygnus Solutions is writing a Java
front-end for the GNU compiler, gcc, in order to translate Java
bytecodes to machine code. This uses a widely used, proven
technology. In this paper, we discuss issues in implementing Java
using traditional compiler, linker, and debugging technology;
particular emphasis is given to using Java in embedded and limited
memory environments.

<h3><a name="sec1">1 Java implementation</a></h3>

Java (see Bibliography for <A HREF="#JavaSpec">JavaSpec</A>) has
become popular because it is a decent programming language, is
buzzword-compliant (object-oriented and web-enabled), and because it
is implemented by compiling to portable bytecodes (see Bibliography
for <A HREF="#JavaVM">JavaVMSpec</A>). The traditional Java
implementation model is to compile Java source code into
<FONT FACE="COURIER">.class</FONT> files containing machine-independent byte-code
instructions. These <FONT FACE="COURIER">.class</FONT> files are downloaded and
interpreted by a browser or some other Java &quot;Virtual
Machine&quot; (VM). See <A HREF="java1.gif">Figure 1</A> for a
model of the traditional Java implementation.</P>

<P align="center">
<a href="java1.gif"><IMG SRC="java1a.gif" width=300 height=170></a></p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 1: Typical Java implementation</b></P>

<p>However, interpreting bytecodes makes Java program many times
slower than comparable C or C++ programs. One approach to improving
this situation is &quot;Just-In-Time&quot; (JIT) compilers. These
dynamically translate bytecodes to machine code just before a method
is first executed.</P>

<P>This can provide substantial speed-up, but it is still slower than
C or C++. There are three main drawbacks with the JIT approach
compared to conventional compilers: </P>

<UL>
<P><LI>The compilation is done every time the application is executed,
which means start-up times are much worse than pre-compiled
code.</LI></P>

<P><LI>Since the JIT compiler has to run fast (it is run every time
the application is run), it cannot do any non-trivial
optimization. Only simple register allocation and peep-optimizations
are practical. (Some have suggested that JIT could potentially produce
faster code than a stand-alone compiler, since it can dynamically
adjust to specific inputs and hardware. But the need for quick
re-compilation will make it very difficult to make JIT faster in
practice.)</LI></P>

<P><LI>The JIT compiler must remain in (virtual) memory while the
application is executing. This memory may be quite costly in an
embedded application.</LI></P>
</UL>

<P>While JIT compilers have an important place in a Java system, for
frequently used applications it is better to use a more traditional
&quot;ahead-of-time&quot; or batch compiler. While many think of Java
as primarily an internet/web language, others are interested in using
Java as an alternative to traditional languages such as C++, provided
performance is acceptable. For embedded applications, it makes much
more sense to pre-compile the Java program, especially if the program
is to be in ROM.</P>

<P>Cygnus is building a Java programming environment that is based on
a conventional compiler, linker, and debugger, using Java-enhanced
versions of the existing GNU programming tools. These have been ported
to just about every chip in use (including many chips only used in
embedded systems), and so we will have a uniquely portable Java
system. See <A HREF="java2.gif">Figure 2</A> for a model of the
compilation process.</P>

<h3><a name="sec2">2 Issues with embedded Java</a></h3>

<P>Sun’s motto for Java is &quot;Write once, run anywhere&quot;. As
part of that, Sun has been pushing Java as also suitable for embedded
systems, announcing specifications for &quot;Embedded Java&quot; and
&quot;Personal Java&quot; specifications. The latter (just published
at the time of writing) is primarily a restricted library that a Java
application can expect.</P>

<P>&quot;Embedded systems&quot; covers a large spectrum from 4-bit
chips with tens of bytes of RAM, to 32- and 64-bit systems with
megabytes of RAM. I believe it will be very difficult to squeeze a
reasonably complete implementation of Java into less than one
MB. (However, people have managed to squeeze a much reduced Java into
credit-card-sized &quot;smart cards&quot; with about 100kB.) In
general, there is less memory available than in the typical desktop
environment where Java usually runs. Those designers that have been
leery of C++ because of performance concerns (perceived or real) will
not embrace Java. On the other hand, those that have been leery of C++
because of its complexity will find Java easier to master.</P>

<P><a href="#top">Top of Page</a><p>

<blockquote>
<h4><a name="sec2_1">2.1 Advantages of Java</a></P></h4>
</blockquote>

<P>Java has a number of advantages for embedded systems. Using classes
to organize the code enforces modularity, and encourages data
abstraction. Java has many useful and standardized classes (for
graphics, networking, simple math and containers,
internationalization, files, and much more). This means a designer can
count on having these libraries on any (full) implementation of
Java.</P>

<P>Java programs are generally more portable than C or C++ programs: </P>

<UL>
<P><LI>The size of integer, floats, and character is defined by the
language.</LI></P>

<P><LI>The order and precision of expression evaluation is
defined.</LI></P>

<P><LI>Initial values of fields are defined, and the languages require
that local variables be set before use in a way that the compiler can
check.</LI></P>
</UL>

<P>In fact, the only major non-determinacy in Java is due to
time-dependencies between interacting threads. Safety-critical
applications will find the following features very useful: </P>

<UL>
<P><LI>More disciplined use of pointers, called &quot;references&quot;
instead, provides &quot;pointer safety&quot; (no dangling references;
all references are either null or point to an actual object;
de-referencing a null pointer raises an exception).</LI></P>

<P><LI>Array indexing is checked, and an index out of bounds raises an
exception.</LI></P>

<P><LI>Using exceptions makes it easier to separate out the normal
case from error cases, and to handle the error in a disciplined
manner.</LI></P></UL>

<P>The portability of Java (including a portable binary format) means
that an application can run on many hardware platforms, with no
porting effort (at least that’s the theory). </P>

<blockquote>
<h4><a name="sec2_2">2.2 Code compactness</a></h4>
</blockquote>

<P>It has been argued that even for ROM-based embedded systems (where
portability is not an issue), it still makes sense to use a
bytecode-based implementation of Java, since the bytecodes are
supposedly more compact than native code. However, it is not at all
clear if that is really the case. The actual bytecode instructions of
the Fib class (a program to calculate Fibonacci numbers, which is
discussed in the section, <A HREF="#sec5">5. Status</A>) only
take 134 bytes, while the compiled instructions for i86 and Sparc take
373 and 484 bytes respectively. (This is if we assume external classes
are also pre-compiled; otherwise, 417 and 540 bytes are needed,
respectively.) However, there is quite a bit of symbol table
information necessary, bringing the actual size of the
<font face="Courier">Fib.class</FONT> file up to 1227 bytes. How much space will
actually be used at run-time depends on how the symbolic (reflective)
information is represented - but it does take a fair bit of
space. (Pre-compiled code also needs space for the reflective data
structure –about 520 bytes for this example.) Out tentative
conclusion is that the space advantage of bytecodes is minor at best,
whereas the speed penalty is major.</P>

<P><a href="#top">Top of Page</a><p>

<blockquote>
<h4><a name="sec2_3">2.3 Space for standard run-time</a></h4>
</blockquote>

<P>In addition to the space needed for the user code, there is also a
large chunk of fixed code for the run-time environment. This includes
code for the standard libraries (such as <FONT
FACE="COURIER">java.lang</FONT>), code
for loading new classes, the garbage collector, and an interpreter or
just-in-time compiler.</P>

<P>In a memory-tight environment, it is desirable to be able to leave
out some of this support code. For example, if there is no need for
loading new classes at run-time, we can leave out the code for reading
class files, and interpreting (or JIT-compiling) bytecodes. (If you
have a dynamic loader, you could still down-load new classes, if you
compile them off-line.) Similarly, some embedded applications might
not need support for Java’s Abstract Windowing Toolkit, or
networking, or decryption, while another might need some or all of
these.</P>

<P>Depending on a conventional (static) linker to select only the code
that is actually needed does not work, since a Java class can be
referenced using a run-time String expression passed to the
<FONT FACE="COURIER">Class.forName</FONT> method. If that feature is not used, then a
static linker can be used.</P>

<P>The Java run-time needs to have access to the name and type of
every field and method of every class that is loaded. This is not
needed for normal operation (especially not when using precompiled
methods); however, a program can examine this information using the
<FONT FACE="COURIER">java.lang.reflect</FONT> package. Furthermore,
the Java Native
Interface (JNI, a standard ABI for interfacing between C/C++ and Java)
works by looking up fields and methods by name at run-time. Using the
JNI thus requires extra run-time memory for field and method
information. Since the JNI is also quite slow, an embedded application
may prefer to use a lower-level (but less portable) Native
Interface.</P>

<P>Because applications and resources vary so widely, it is important
to have a Java VM/run-time than can be easily configured. Some
applications may need access to dynamically loaded classes, the Java
Native Interface, reflection, and a large class library. Other
applications may need none of these, and cannot afford the space
requirements of those features. Different clients may also want
different algorithms for garbage collection or different thread
implementations. This implies the need for a configuration utility, so
one can select the features one wants in a VM, much like one might
need to configure kernel options before building an operating
system.</P>

<P><a href="#top">Top of Page</a><p>

<blockquote>
<h4><a name="sec2_4">2.4 Garbage collection</a></h4>
</blockquote>

<P>Programmers used to traditional malloc/free-style heap management
tend to be skeptical about the efficiency of garbage collection. It is
true that garbage collection usually takes a significant toll on
execution time, and can lead to large unpredictable pauses. However,
it is important to remember that is also an issue for manual heap
allocations using malloc and free. There are many very poorly written
<FONT FACE="COURIER">malloc/free</FONT> implementations in common use,
just as there are inefficient implementations of garbage collection.</P>

<P>There are a number of incremental, parallel, or generational
garbage collection algorithms that provide performance as good or
better than <FONT FACE="COURIER">malloc/free</FONT>. What is
difficult, however, is ensuring that pause times are
bounded—<I>i.e</I>., a small limit on
the amount of time a new can take, even if garbage collection is
triggered. The solution is to make sure to do a little piece of
garbage collection on each allocation. Unfortunately, the only known
algorithms that can handle hard-real time either require hardware
assistance or are very inefficient. However, &quot;soft&quot;
real-time can be implemented at reasonable cost.</P>

<h3><a name="sec3">3 Compiling Java</a></h3>

<P>The core tool of Cygnus’s Java implementation is the
compiler. This is <FONT FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT>, a new <FONT
FACE="COURIER">gcc</FONT> front-end (see
Bibliography for <A HREF="#GCC">GCC</A>). This has similar structure
as existing front-ends (such as <FONT FACE="COURIER">cc1plus</FONT>, the C++
front-end), and shares most of the code with them. The most unusual
aspect of <FONT FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT> is that its &quot;parser&quot; reads
<I>either</I> Java source files or Java bytecode files. (The first
release will only directly support bytecodes; parsing Java source will
be done by invoking Sun’s <FONT FACE="COURIER">javac</FONT>. A
future version will
provide an integrated Java parser, largely for the sake of compilation
speed.) In any case, it is important that <FONT
FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT> can read
bytecodes, for the following reasons: </P>


<UL>
<P><LI>It is the natural way to get declarations of external classes;
in this respect, a Java bytecode file is like a C++ pre-compiled
header file.</LI></P>

<P><LI>It is needed so we can support code produced from other tools
that produce Java bytecodes (such as the Kawa Scheme-to-Java-bytecode
compiler; see Bibliography for <A HREF="#Kawa">Kawa</A>).</LI></P>

<P><LI>Some libraries are (unfortunately) distributed as Java
bytecodes without source.</LI></P>
</UL>

<P>Much of the work of the compiler is the same whether we are
compiling from source code or from byte codes. For example emitting
code to handle method invocation is the same either way. When we
compile from source, we need a parser, semantic analysis, and
error-checking. On the other hand, when parsing from bytecodes, we
need to extract higher-level information from the lower-level
bytecodes, which we will discuss in <A HREF="#sec3_1">3.1
Transforming bytecodes</A>.</P>

<P><a href="#top">Top of Page</a><p>

<blockquote>
<h4><A NAME="sec3_1">3.1 Transforming bytecodes</A></h4>
</blockquote>

<P>This section describes how <FONT FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT> works.</P>

<P>The executable content of a bytecode file contains a vector of
bytecode instructions for each (non-native) method. The bytecodes are
instructions for an abstract machine with some local variable
registers and a stack used for expression evaluation. (The first few
local variables are initialized with the actual parameters.) Each
local variable or stack &quot;slot&quot; is a word big enough for
either a 32-bit integer, a float, or an object reference
(pointer). (Two slots are used for 64-bits doubles and longs.) The
slots are not typed; <I>i.e.</I>, at one point, a slot might contain
an integer value, and, at another point, the same slot might contain
an object reference. However, you cannot store an integer in a slot,
and then retrieve the same bits re-interpreted as an object
reference. Moreover, at any given program point, each slot has a
unique type can be determined using static data flow. (The type may be
&quot;unassigned&quot;, in which case you are not allowed to read the
slot’s value.) These restrictions are part of Java security model,
and are enforced by the Java bytecode verifier. We do a similar
analysis in <FONT FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT>, which lets us know for
every program
point, the current stack pointer, and the type of every local variable
and stack slot.</P>

<P>Internally <FONT FACE="COURIER">gcc</FONT> uses two main
representations: The tree
representation is at the level of an abstract syntax tree, and is used
to represent high-level (fully-typed) expressions, declarations, and
types. The <FONT FACE="COURIER">rtl</FONT> (Register Transform
Language) form is used
to represent instructions, instruction patterns, and machine-level
calculations in general. Constant folding is done using
<FONT FACE="COURIER">trees</FONT>, but otherwise most optimizations
are done at the
<FONT FACE="COURIER">rtl</FONT> level.</P>

<P>The basic strategy for translating Java stack-oriented bytecodes is
that we create a dummy local variable for each Java local variable or
stack slot. These are mapped to <FONT FACE="COURIER">gcc</FONT> &quot;virtual
registers,&quot; and standard <FONT FACE="COURIER">gcc</FONT> register
allocation later
assigns each virtual register to a hard register or a stack
location. This makes it easy to map each opcode into
<FONT FACE="COURIER">tree</FONT>-nodes or <FONT
FACE="COURIER">rtl</FONT> to manipulate the virtual
registers.</P>

<P>As an example, consider how to compile <FONT
FACE="COURIER">iadd</FONT>, which adds
the top two ints on the stack. For illustration, assume the stack
pointer is 3, and virtual registers 50, 51, and 52 are associated with
stack slots 0, 1, and 2. The code generated by <FONT
FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT> is the
following: </P>
<blockquote>
<font face="courier">        reg51 := vreg51 + vreg52</font>
</blockquote>
<P>Note that the stack exists only at compile-time. There is no stack,
stack pointer, or stack operations in the emitted code.</P>

<P>This simple model has some problems, compared to conventional
compilers: </P>

<UL>
<P><LI>We would like to do constant folding, which is done at the
<FONT FACE="COURIER">tree</FONT> level. However, <FONT FACE="COURIER">tree</FONT> nodes are
typed.</LI></P>

<P><LI>The simple-minded approach uses lots of virtual registers, and
the code generated is very bad. Running the optimizer (with the
<FONT FACE="COURIER">-O</FONT> flag) fixes the generated code, but you still get a lot
of useless stack slots. It would be nice not to <I>have</I> <I>to</I>
run the optimizer, and if you do, not to make unnecessary work for
it.</LI></P>

<P><LI>The <FONT FACE="COURIER">rtl</FONT> representation is semi-typed, since it
distinguishes the various machine &quot;modes&quot; such as pointer,
and different-sized integers and floats. This causes problems because
a given Java stack slot may have different types at different points
in the code.</LI></P>
</UL>

<P>The last problem we solve by using a separate virtual register for
each machine mode. For example, for local variable slot 5 we might use
<FONT FACE="COURIER">vreg40</FONT> when it contains an integer, and <FONT FACE="COURIER">vreg41</FONT>
when it points an object reference. This is safe, because the Java
verifier does not allow storing an integer in an object slot and later
reusing the same value as an object reference or float.</P>

<P>The other two problems we solve by modeling the stack as a stack of
<FONT FACE="COURIER">tree</FONT> nodes, and not storing the results in their
&quot;home&quot; virtual registers unless we have to. Thus jc1actually
does the following for <FONT FACE="COURIER">iadd</FONT>: </P>

<blockquote><P><FONT FACE="COURIER">
	     tree arg1 = pop_value (int_type_node);<br>
             tree arg2 = pop_value (int_type_node);<br>
             push_value (fold (build (PLUS_EXPR, int_type_node, arg1,
arg2)));<br></font></P>
</blockquote>
<P>The build function is the standard <FONT FACE="COURIER">gcc</FONT> function for
creating <FONT FACE="COURIER">tree</FONT>-nodes, while fold is the standard function
for doing constant folding. The functions <FONT FACE="COURIER">pop_value</FONT> and
<FONT FACE="COURIER">push_value</FONT> are specific to <FONT FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT>, and keep track
of which stack location corresponds to which <FONT FACE="COURIER">tree</FONT> node. No
code is actually generated–yet.</P>

<P>This works for straight-line code (i.e. within a basic block). When
we come to a branch or a branch target, we have to flush the stack of
<FONT FACE="COURIER">tree</FONT> nodes, and make sure the value of each stack slot gets
saved in its &quot;home&quot; virtual register. The stack is usually
empty at branches and branch targets, so this does not happen very
often. Otherwise, we only emit actual <FONT FACE="COURIER">rtl </FONT>instructions to
evaluate the expressions when we get to a side-effecting operation
(such as a store or a method call).</P>

<P>Since we only allocate a virtual register when we need one, we are
now using fewer virtual registers, which leads to better code. We also
get the benefits of <FONT FACE="COURIER">gcc</FONT> constant folding, plus the existing
machinery for selecting the right instructions for addition and other
expressions.</P>

<P>The result is that we end up generating code using the same
mechanisms that the <FONT FACE="COURIER">gcc</FONT> C and C++ front-ends do, and
therefore we can expect similar code quality.</P>

<h4><a name="sec3_2">3.2 Class meta-data</a></h4>
</blockquote>

<P>Compiling the executable content is only part of the problem. The
Java run-time also needs an extensive data structure that describes
each class with its fields and methods. This is the
&quot;meta-data&quot; or &quot;reflective&quot; data for the
class. The compiler has to somehow make it possible for the run-time
system to correctly initialize the data structures before the compiled
classes can be used.</P>

<P>If we are compiling from bytecodes, the compiler can just pass
through the meta-data as they are encoded in the class file. (If the
run-time supports dynamically loading new classes, it already knows
how to read meta-data from a class file.)</P>

<P>It is inconvenient if the meta-data and the compiled code are in
different files. The run-time should be able to create its
representation of the meta-data without having to go beyond its
address space. For example reading in the meta-data from an external
file may cause consistency problems, and it may not even be possible
for embedded systems.</P>

<P>A possible solution is to emit something like: </P>
<blockquote>
<P><font face="courier">     
	static const char FooClassData[] = "\xCa\xfe\xba\xbe...";<br>
        static {<br>
		LoadClassFromByteArray(FooClassData);<br>
		Patch up method to point to code;<br>
</font></p>
</blockquote>
<P>The code marked <FONT FACE="COURIER">static</FONT> is compiled into
a dummy function
that is executed at program startup. This can be handled using
whatever mechanism is used to execute C++ static initializers. This
dummy function reads the meta-data in external format from
<FONT FACE="COURIER">FooClassData</FONT>, creates the internal
representation, and
enters the class into the class table. It then patches up the method
descriptors so that they point to the compiled code.</P>

<P>This works, but it is rather wasteful in terms of memory and
startup time. We need space for both the external representation (in
<FONT FACE="COURIER">FooClassData</FONT>) and the internal representation, and we have
to spend time creating the latter from the former. It is much better
if we can have the compiler directly create the internal
representation. If we use initialized static data, we can have the
compiler statically allocate and initialize the internal data
structures. This means the actual initialization needed at run is very
little &ETH; most of it is just entering the meta-data into a global
symbol table.</P>

<P>Consider the following example class: </P>
<blockquote>
<P><font face="courier">	
	 public class Foo extends Bar {<br>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public int a;<br>
	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public int f(int j) { return a+j; }<br>
	 };<br>
</font></p>
</blockquote>

<P>That class compiles into something like the following: </P>

<blockquote>
<font face="courier"><P>int Foo_f (Foo* this, int j)<BR>
{ return this-&gt;a + j; }<BR>
 <BR>
struct Method Foo_methods[1] = {{<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* name: */   "f";<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* code: */   (Code) &amp;Foo_f;<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* access: */ PUBLIC,<BR>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* etc */     ... <BR>
}};<BR>
<BR>
struct Class Foo_class = {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   /* name: */        "Foo",<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   /* num_methods: */ 1,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   /* methods: */     Foo_methods,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   /* super: */       &amp;Bar_class,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   /* num_fields: */  1,<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   /* etc */          ...<BR>
};<BR>
<BR>
static {<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  RegisterClass (&amp;Foo_class, "Foo");<BR>
} </P>
</FONT>
</blockquote>
<P>Thus startup is fast, and does not require any dynamic allocation.</P>

<h4><a name="sec3_3">3.3 Static references</a></h4>
</blockquote>

<P>A class may make references to <FONT FACE="COURIER">static</FONT>
fields and methods of another class. If we can assume that the other
class will also be <FONT FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT>-compiled, then
<FONT FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT> can emit a direct reference to the
external <FONT FACE="COURIER">static</FONT> field or method (just like
a C++ compiler would). That is, a call to a <FONT
FACE="COURIER">static</FONT> method can be compiled as a direct
function call. If you want to make a static call from a pre-compiled
class to a known class that you do <I>not</I> know is pre-compiled,
you can try using extra indirection and a &quot;trampoline&quot; stub
that jumps to the correct method. (Not that this feature is very
useful: it makes little sense to pre-compile a class without also
pre-compiling the other classes that it statically depends on.)</P>

<P>A related problem has to do with string constants. The language
specification requires that string literals that are equal will
compile into the same String object at run-time. This complicates
separate compilation, and it makes it difficult to statically allocate
the strings (as in done for C), unless you have a truly unusual
linker. So, we compile references to string literals as indirect
references to a pointer that gets initialized at class initialization
time.</P>

<P><a href="#top">Top of Page</a><p>

<blockquote>
<h4><a name="sec3_4">3.4 Linking</a></h4>
</blockquote>

<P>The <FONT FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT> program creates standard
assembler files that are processed by the standard unmodified GNU
assembler. The resulting object files can be placed in a dynamic or
static library, or linked (together with the run-time system) into an
executable, using a standard linker. The only linker extension we
really need is support for static initializers, but we already have
that (since <FONT FACE="COURIER">gcc</FONT> supports C++).</P>

<P>While we do not <I>need</I> any linker modification, there are some
that may be desirable. Here are some ideas.</P>

<P>Java needs a lot of names at run-time <B>–</B>for classes,
files, local variables, methods, type signatures, and source
files. These are represented in the constant pool of <FONT
FACE="COURIER">.class</FONT> files as <FONT
FACE="COURIER">CONSTANT_Utf8</FONT> values. Compilation removes the
need for many of these names (because it resolves many symbolic field
and method references). However, names are still needed for the
meta-data. Two different class files may generate two references the
same name. It may be desirable to combine them to save space (and to
speed up equality tests). That requires linker support. The compiler
could place these names in a special section of the object file, and
the linker could then combine identical names.</P>

<P>The run-time maintains a global table of all loaded classes, so it
can find a class given its name. When most of the classes are
statically compiled and allocated, it is reasonable to pre-compute
(the static part of) the global class table. One idea is that the
linker could build a perfect hash table of the classes in a library or
program.</P>

<P><a href="#top">Top of Page</a><p>

<h3><a name="sec4">4. Run-time</a></h3>

<P>Running a compiled Java program will need a suitable Java run-time
environment. This is in principle no different from C++ (which
requires an extensive library, as well as support for memory
allocation, exceptions, and so on). However, Java requires more
run-time support than &quot;traditional&quot; languages: It needs
support for threads, garbage collection, type reflection (meta-data),
and all the primitive Java methods. Full Java support also means being
able to dynamically load new bytecoded classes, though this may not be
needed in some embedded environments. Basically, the appropriate Java
run-time environment is a Java Virtual Machine.</P>

<P>It is possible to have <FONT FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT> produce code
compatible with the Java Native Interface ABI. Such code could run
under any Java VM that implements the JNI. However, the JNI has
relatively high overhead, so if you are not concerned about binary
portability it is better to use a more low-level ABI, similar to the
VM’s internal calling convention. (If you are concerned about
portability, use <FONT FACE="COURIER">.class</FONT> files.) While we
plan to support the portable JNI, we will also support such a
lower-level ABI. Certainly the standard Java functionality (such as
that in <FONT FACE="COURIER">java.lang</FONT> will be compiled to the
lower-level ABI.</P>

<P>A low-level ABI is inherently dependent on a specific VM. We are
using <B><I>Kaffe—a free Java VM</B></I>, written by Tim Wilkinson
(see Bibliography for <A HREF="#Kaffe">Kaffe</A>), with help from
volunteers around the &quot;Net.&quot; Kaffe uses either a JIT
compiler on many common platforms, or a conventional bytecode
interpreter, which is quite portable (except for thread
support). Using a JIT compiler makes it easy to call between
pre-compiled and dynamically loaded methods (since both use the same
calling convention).</P>

<P>We are making many enhancements to make Kaffe a more suitable
target for pre-compiled code. One required change is to add a hook so
that pre-compiled and pre-allocated classes can be added to the global
table of loaded classes. This means implementing the <FONT
FACE="COURIER">RegisterClass</FONT> function.</P>

<P>Other changes are not strictly needed, but are highly
desirable. The original Kaffe meta-data had some redundant
data. Sometimes redundancy can increase run-time efficiency
(<I>e.g</I>., caching, or a method dispatch table for virtual method
calls). However, the gain has to be balanced against the extra
complication and space. Space is especially critical for embedded
applications, which is an important target for us. Therefore, we have
put some effort into streamlining the Kaffe data structures, such as
replacing linked lists by arrays.</P>

<blockquote>
<h4><a name="sec4_1">4.1 Debugging</a></h4>
</blockquote>

<P>Our debugging strategy for Java is to enhance <FONT
FACE="COURIER">gdb </FONT>(the GNU debugger) so it can understand
Java-compiled code. This follows from our philosophy of treating Java
like other programming languages. This also makes it easier to debug
multi-language applications (C <I>and</I> Java).</P>

<P>Adding support for Java requires adding a Java expression parser,
and routines to print values and types in Java syntax. It should be
easy to modify the existing C and C++ language support routines, since
Java expressions and primitive types are very similar to those of
C++. </P>

<P>Adding support for Java objects is somewhat more work. Getting,
setting, and printing of <FONT FACE="COURIER">Object</FONT> fields is
basically the same as for C++. Printing an Object reference can be
done using a format similar to that used by the default <FONT
FACE="COURIER">toString</FONT> method –the class followed by the
address such as <FONT
FACE="COURIER">java.io.DataInput@cf3408</FONT>. Sometimes you instead
want to print the <I>contents</I> of the object, rather than its
address (or identity). Strings should, by default, be printed using
their contents, rather than their address. For other objects, <FONT
FACE="COURIER">gdb </FONT>can invoke the <FONT
FACE="COURIER">toString</FONT> method to get a printable
representation, and print that. However, there should be different
options to get different styles of output.</P>

<FONT FACE="COURIER"><P>gdb </FONT>can evaluate a general
user-supplied expression, including a function call. For Java, this
means we must add support for invoking a method in the program we are
debugging. Thus, <FONT FACE="COURIER">gdb </FONT>has to be able to
know the structure of the Java meta-data so it can find the right
method. Alternatively, <FONT FACE="COURIER">gdb </FONT>could invoke
functions in the VM to do the job on its behalf.</P>

<FONT FACE="COURIER"><P>gdb </FONT>has an internal representation of
the types of the variables and functions in the program being
debugged. Those are read from the symbol-table section of the
executable file. To some extent this information duplicates the
meta-data that we already need in the program’s address space. We
can save some file space if we avoid putting duplicate meta-data in
the symbol table section, and instead extend <FONT FACE="COURIER">gdb
</FONT>so it can get the information it needs from the running
process. This also makes gdb start-up faster, since it makes it easier
to only create type information when needed.</P>

<P>Potentially duplicated meta-data includes the source line
numbers. This is because a Java program needs to be able to do a stack
trace, even without an external debugger. Ideally, the stack trace
should include source line numbers. Therefore, it is best to put the
line numbers in a special read-only section of the executable. This
would be pointed to by the method meta-data, where both gdb and the
internal Java stack dumper can get at it. (For embedded systems one
would probably leave out line numbers in the run-time, and only keep
it in the debug section of the executable file.) </P>

<P>Extracting symbolic information from the process rather than from
the executable file is also more flexible, since it makes it easier to
also support new classes that are loaded in at run-time. While the
first releases will concentrate on debugging pre-compiled Java code,
we will want to debug bytecodes that have been dynamically loaded into
the VM. This problem is eased if the VM uses JIT (as Kaffe does),
since in that case the representation of dynamically-(JIT-)compiled
Java code is the same as pre-compiled code. However, we still need to
provide hooks so that <FONT FACE="COURIER">gdb </FONT>knows when a new
class is loaded into the VM.</P>

<P>Long-term, it might be useful to download Java code into <FONT
FACE="COURIER">gdb </FONT>itself (so we can extend <FONT
FACE="COURIER">gdb </FONT>using Java), but that requires integrating a
Java evaluator into <FONT FACE="COURIER">gdb</FONT>.</P>

<h4><a name="sec4_2">4.2 Profiling</a></h4>

<P>One problem with Java is the lack of profiling tools. This makes it

<h3><A NAME="sec5">5 Status</a></h3>

<P>As of early July 1997, <FONT FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT> was able to
compile a simple test program, which calculates the Fibonacci numbers
(up to 36), both iteratively and recursively (which is slow!), and
prints the results. No manual tinkering was needed with the assembly
code generated, which was assembled and linked in with <FONT
FACE="COURIER">kaffe</FONT> (a modified pre-0.9.1 snapshot) as the
run-time engine. On a SparcStation 5 running Solaris2, it took 16
seconds to execute. In comparison, the same program dynamically
compiled by Kaffe’s JIT takes 26 seconds, and Sun’s JDK 1.1
takes 88 seconds to run the same program.</P>

<P>These numbers are encouraging, but they need some context. Start-up
times (for class loading and just-in-time compilation) should in all
cases be fairly minor, since the execution time is dominated by
recursive calls. In the <FONT FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT>-compiled case,
only the actually test class (calculating Fibonacci plus the main
methods that prints the result) is compiled by jc1; all the other
classes loaded (including the classes for I/O) are compiled by <FONT
FACE="COURIER">kaffe</FONT>’s JIT-compiler. This means there would
be some slight extra speed up if all the classes were <FONT
FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT>-compiled. Do note that the test-program uses
simple C-like features that are easy to compile: integer arithmetic,
simple control structures, and direct recursion. The results cannot be
directly generalized to larger programs that use object-oriented
features more heavily.</P>

<P>The basic structure of the compiler works, but there is still quite
a bit of work to do. Many of the byte-codes are not supported yet, and
neither is exception handling. Only some very simple Java-specific
optimizations are implemented. (Of course, <FONT
FACE="COURIER">jc1</FONT> benefits from the existing
language-independent optimizations in <FONT
FACE="COURIER">gcc</FONT>.)</P>

<P>The Kaffe VM works on most Java code. We have enhanced it in
various ways, and modified the data structures to be simpler and more
suitable for being emitted by the compiler.</P>

<P>The Java support in the <FONT FACE="COURIER">gdb</FONT> debugger is
partially written, but there is still quite a bit to go before it is
user-friendly. We have not started work on our own library
implementation or source-code compiler.</P>
