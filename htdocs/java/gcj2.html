<h2 align=center>The GCJ home page</h2>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>We've written a front end to the GCC compiler which can natively
compile both Java<sup><a href="#javatm">tm</a></sup> source and
bytecode files.  The compiler can also generate class files.  This new
front end is integrated into the <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> project.


<h2>What you get</h2>

<p>The currently available code consists of several programs:

<dl>

<dt><tt>gcj</tt></dt>
<dd>
   A front end to gcc which is able to read Java ``.class'' files and
   generate assembly code.  gcj is also a convenient front end to
   jvgenmain.  Finally, gcj can read ``.java'' files and generate
   assembly code or Java bytecode.
</dd>

<dt><tt>jvgenmain</tt></dt>
<dd> 
   A small program to generate an appropriate ``main'' for a Java class.
</dd>

<dt><tt>gcjh</tt></dt>
<dd>
   A program to generate C++ header files corresponding to Java 
   .class files.
</dd>

<dt><tt>jcf-dump</tt></dt>
<dd>
   Reads a ``.class'' file and prints out all sorts of useful
   information.
</dd>

<dt><tt>jv-scan</tt></dt>
<dd>
   Reads a ``.java'' file and prints some useful information.
   For instance, it can tell you which classes are defined in that file.
</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Making executables</h2>

    <p>In order to make full executables, you'll need to link the
    output of gcj with the appropriate runtime code.  See <a
    href="libgcj2.html">the libgcj page</a> for details on the runtime.
    Note that you'll want to configure GCC to build libjava; see
    <a href="build-snapshot.html">configuration and build instructions
    for GCJ</a>.


    <p>There are also <a href="compile.html">more detailed
	instructions</a> on compiling Java programs.

<h2>How to get it</h2>

<p>The new Java front end is very easy to download and install.  Since
it is it fully integrated into GCC, you can simply follow the <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/cvs.html">GCC download and build
instructions</a>.  Note that you'll want to configure GCC to use the
appropriate threads system; see <a
href="libgcj2.html">the libgcj page</a> for details.

<h2>How to try it</h2>

<p>Once you've downloaded and installed gcj and libgcj, it is very
easy to try a small Java program of your own:
      <pre>
	gcj --main=HelloWorld -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.java
	./HelloWorld
      </pre>
