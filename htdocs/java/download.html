The most current official release of GCJ and libgcj is 3.0, which is included 
with the GCC 3.0 source distribution. 
<p>
Follow the links on <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html">http://gcc.gnu.org/releases.html</a>
to download the compiler.  You will need either the full distribution,
or each of the Core Compiler, C++ and Java distributions.

<p>
Many GNU/Linux distributions now include relatively recent, "QA'ed" versions of 
GCJ which should work out-of-the-box. Look for packages like "gcc-java" and
"gcc-libgcj" to add Java language support to your existing GCC installation.

 Development Sources

The latest development sources are available in three forms: periodic
snapshots, pre-built RPMs and directly from the cvs source repository.

<p>
Please note that the current development source tree may occasionally have 
bugs which prevent it from compiling or running; however, when these problems 
occur we try to fix them immediately. Please
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?user=guest&amp;password=guest&amp;database=gcc&amp;cmd=login">submit a problem report</a> if you are
using the development sources and run into such a problem.
If you are going to build from source you want to read the
<a href=faq.html#3_0>Build Issues FAQ</a>.

<h3>Snapshots</h3>
Snapshots of the current CVS tree are made about once a week.  They are 
available from <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/snapshots.html">
http://gcc.gnu.org/snapshots.html</a>.

<h3><a name=cvs>cvs</a></h3> 

The easiest way to get GCJ is to check it out from the GCC cvs
repository. Here's how perform an anonymous <A
HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/cvs.html">read-only</A> CVS access:

<small>
<pre>
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@gcc.gnu.org:/cvs/gcc login
  (password is ``anoncvs'')
cvs -z9 -d:pserver:anoncvs@gcc.gnu.org:/cvs/gcc co gcc
</pre>
</small>
<p>

Here's how to perform a <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/cvswrite.html">
read-write</A> CVS access, provided that you're were given a account
on <tt>gcc.gnu.org</tt>:

<small>
<pre>
cvs -z 9 -d :ext:username@gcc.gnu.org:/cvs/gcc co gcc
</pre>
</small>

<h3>cvsweb</h3>

You can also view the libgcj component cvs archive: the 
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gcc/boehm-gc/">boehm-gc</A>,
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gcc/libffi/">libffi</A>,

and <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gcc/fastjar/">fastjar</A>.
<p>
Here's the Java front end <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gcc/gcc/java">cvs
archive</a> (the entire compiler is also 
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/gcc">available</a>.)
