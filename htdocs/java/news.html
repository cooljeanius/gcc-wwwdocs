Jeff Sturm has adapted Jan Hubicka's call graph optimization code to gcj.
This code improves gcj's method inlining abilities with support for
out-of-order methods and inter-class method calls, along with improved
code size heuristics.  It is enabled by default when compiling at -O3.

Gary Benson from Red Hat has released

of the <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/rhug/">rhug</a> packages 
that have been repackaged for eventual inclusion in Red Hat Linux. 
Naoko basically comprises binary RPMS of Ant, Tomcat, and their 
dependencies built with gcj.

Adam Megacz has contributed a mingw32 port of libgcj.  This port is
still a little bit incomplete (e.g., <code>java.lang.Process</code>
doesn't work), and it currently only works as a target, not a host.
Still, it works, and he is using it for <a

Bryce McKinlay has contributed a patch to optimize some of the array
access and added a new compiler flag, <code>--no-store-check</code>,
to disable assignability checks for stores into object arrays. With
code that is known not to throw <code>ArrayStoreException</code>, this
flag can be used to disable the check operations. In which case it can
provide a reasonable performance boost and slight code size reduction.

<tr><td valign="top">
<b>January 22, 2002</b>

Tom Tromey has contributed a patch to allow certain Java method calls

some infrastructure to make it easy to add more such inlines when
desired.

Richard Stallman has changed the licensing of the Classpath AWT
implementation to match the licensing of the rest of Classpath.  This
means that the only remaining barrier to AWT for libgcj is manpower.
Work has already begun to merge the Classpath and libgcj AWT
implementations.

<b>September 7, 2001</b>

Anthony Green of Red Hat has added a facility for compiling property
files and other system resources into libraries and executables.
These files are accessible to the gcj runtime via the new "core"
protocol handler.  The gcj runtime places "core:/" at the end of the
java.class.path, ensuring that compiled-in resource files are
discovered and loaded when required.  This is a convenient feature for
building and deploying libraries and executables with no external file
dependencies.  See the <code>--resource</code> option in the gcj
manual for details.

servlet-like class.

We now have a new hash-table based lightweight lock implementation which was

Made use of Warren Levy's change to the
<a href="http://sources.redhat.com/mauve/">Mauve test suite</a> to handle
regressions.
Modifications have been made to <tt>mauve.exp</tt> to copy the newly created
<tt>xfails</tt> file of known library failures from the source tree
to the directory where the libjava <tt>'make check'</tt> is being run.  
This allows the testsuite to ignore <tt>XFAIL</tt>s and thus highlight
true regressions in the library.  The Mauve tests are
automatically run as part of a libjava
<tt>'make check'</tt> as long as the Mauve suite is accessible
