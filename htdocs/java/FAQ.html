    <h2 align=center>The GCJ FAQ</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>What license is used for libgcj?</dt>
      <dd>libgcj is distributed under the Library GPL.</dd>

      <dt>How can I report a bug in libgcj?</dt>
      <dd>libgcj has a corresponding
	<a
      href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cgi-bin/gnatsweb.pl?user=guest&password=guest&database=java&cmd=login">Gnats
	  bug database</a> which you can browse.  You can also submit new
	bug reports from the Gnats page.</dd>

      <dt>How can I contribute to libgcj?</dt>
      <dd>You can send simple bug fixes in as patches.  Please follow
	the <a href="http://egcs.cygnus.com/contribute.html">GCC guidelines
	for submitting patches</a>.
	For more complex changes, you must sign copyright over to
	Cygnus.  The forms for doing this are not yet available, but
	will be soon.</dd>

      <dt>How can I debug my Java program?</dt>
      <dd><a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gdb/gdb-4.18.tar.gz">gdb
	4.18</a> includes support for debugging gcj-compiled Java
	programs.</dd>

      <dt>Why isn't libgcj part of GCC?</dt>
      <dd>Copyright problems.  It's possible that libgcj will end up
	in GCC at some point in the future.</dd>

      <dt>Will gcj and libgcj work on my machine?</dt>
      <dd>So far gcj and libgcj have only really been tried on Sparc
	Solaris and x86 Linux.  They might work on other systems, but
	we don't know.  Generally speaking, porting to a new system
	should not be hard.  This would be a good way to volunteer.</dd>

      <dt>My program is dumping core!  What's going on?</dt>
      <dd>I could be any number of things.  One common mistake is 
        having your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> environment variable pointing
	at a third party's java.lang and friends.  Either
	unset <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>, or make sure it does not refer to 
        core libraries other than those found in libgcj.zip.</dd>
