    <h2 align=center>The GCJ FAQ</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>What license is used for libgcj?</dt>
      <dd>libgcj is distributed under the Library GPL.</dd>

      <dt>How can I contribute to libgcj?</dt>
      <dd>You can send simple bug fixes in as patches.  Please follow
	the <a href="http://egcs.cygnus.com/contribute.html">egcs guidelines
	for submitting patches</a>.
	For more complex changes, you must sign copyright over to
	Cygnus.  The forms for doing this are not yet available, but
	will be soon.</dd>

      <dt>How can I debug my Java program?</dt>
      <dd><a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gdb/gdb-4.18.tar.gz">gdb
	4.18</a> includes support for debugging gcj-compiled Java
	programs.</dd>

      <dt>I've downloaded egcs, but I don't see gcj.  Where is it?</dt>
      <dd>Although gcj has been in the egcs cvs repository for some time
	now, it has not appeared in any official releases.  It will
	be included in the coming 1.2 release.  Until then you will
	need to download one of the recent egcs snapshots (which have
	always included gcj), or use anonymous cvs.  See 
	<a href="http://egcs.cygnus.com/">the egcs pages</a> for details.</dd>

      <dt>Why isn't libgcj part of egcs?</dt>
      <dd>Copyright problems.  It's possible that libgcj will end up
	in egcs at some point in the future.</dd>

      <dt>Will gcj and libgcj work on my machine?</dt>
      <dd>So far gcj and libgcj have only really been tried on Sparc
	Solaris and x86 Linux.  They might work on other systems, but
	we don't know.  Generally speaking, porting to a new system
	should not be hard.  This would be a good way to volunteer.</dd>

      <dt>My program is dumping core!  What's going on?</dt>
      <dd>I could be any number of things.  One common mistake is 
        having your <tt>CLASSPATH</tt> environment variable pointing
	at a third party's java.lang and friends.  Either
	unset <tt>CLASSPATH</tt>, or make sure it does not refer to 
        core libraries other than those found in libgcj.zip.</dd>
