<h1 align="center">Contributing Code</h1>

<h2>Coding Standards</h2>

  <p>All contributions must conform to the <a
  href="http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/prep/standards_toc.html">GNU Coding
  Standards</a>.  Submissions which do not conform to the standards will
  be returned with a request to reformat the changes.

  <p>Note that the GNU Coding Standards do not actually cover Java
  programming style.  libgcj largely uses the obvious extrapolation
  from the GNU C style, but there are some differences.  These aren't
  yet written down, but we'll make them available shortly.

<h2>Copyright Assignment</h2>

  <p>Before we can accept code contributions from you, we need a
  copyright assignment form filled out.

  <ul>
   <li>If you've developed some addition or patch to libgcj
   that you would like to contribute, you should fill out a <a
   href="libgcj-assign.txt">copyright assignment
   form</a> and send it in to us.  We are unable to use code from
   you until this is on-file.

   <li>Small changes can be accepted without a copyright assignment form
   on file.

   <li>The above form is for a one-time change submission; you can
   fill out a different assignment to give all future copyrights
   (for a particular program) to Cygnus.
   If you think you're going to be doing continuing work on libgcj
   it will be easiest if you can fill out this form.
   We don't currently have this form available on-line; please send
   us email if you think you need it.
  </ul>

<h2>Submitting Patches</h2>

  <p>Every patch must have several pieces of information before we can
  properly evaluate it.

  <ul>
  <li> A description of the bug and how your patch fixes this bug.  For
       new features a description of the feature and your implementation.
  <li> A ChangeLog entry as plaintext; see the various ChangeLog files
       for format and content.<br>
       Note that, unlike some other projects, we do require ChangeLogs
       also for documentation (i.e., .texi files).
  <li> The patch itself.  If you are accessing the
       CVS repository at Cygnus, use &quot;cvs update; cvs diff -c3p&quot;;
       else, use &quot;diff -c3p OLD NEW&quot; or &quot;diff -up OLD NEW&quot;.
       If your version of diff does not support these options, then get the
       latest version of GNU diff.
  </ul>

    <p>Send patches to <a
	href="mailto:java-patches@sourceware.cygnus.com">the patch mailing
	list</a>.  This list is <a href="/ml/java-patches/">archived</a>.
