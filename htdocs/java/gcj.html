<h2 align=center>The GCJ Homepage</h2>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>We've written a front end to the GCC compiler which can natively
compile both Java<sup><a href="#javatm">tm</a></sup> source and
bytecode files.  This new front end is integrated into the <a
href="http://egcs.cygnus.com/">EGCS</a> project.


<h2>What you get</h2>

<p>The currently available code consists of several programs:

<dl>

<dt><tt>gcj</tt></dt>
<dd>
   A front end to gcc which is able to read Java ``.class'' files
   and generate assembly code.  gcj is also a convenient front end to
   jvgenmain.  Work on a parser to read ``.java'' files is in progress;
   the preliminary code is also available here.
</dd>

<dt><tt>jvgenmain</tt></dt>
<dd> 
   A small program to generate an appropriate ``main'' for a Java class.
</dd>

<dt><tt>gcjh</tt></dt>
<dd>
   A program to generate C++ header files corresponding to Java 
   .class files.
</dd>

<dt><tt>jcf-dump</tt></dt>
<dd>
   Reads a ``.class'' file and prints out all sorts of useful
   information.
</dd>

<dt><tt>jv-scan</tt></dt>
<dd>
   Reads a ``.java'' file and prints some useful information.
   For instance, it can tell you which classes are defined in that file.
</dd>

</dl>

<h2>What it doesn't do</h2>

<p>At this point the compiler cannot be used to generate actual
executables.  The compiler has detailed knowledge about the runtime
environment coded in it, and we have not yet released this runtime.

<h2>What the future holds</h2>

<p>In the future we do plan to release the runtime, which consists of
a minimal class library, a garbage collector (the Boehm conservative
collector), and a cooperative threads package (based on QuickThreads).

<p>We are hard at work finishing the ``.java'' parser so that Java
source files can be directly we compiled; we are writing a back end to
this parser which will generate ``.class'' files; and we are changing
gdb so it can debug Java programs.


<h2>How to get it</h2>

<p>The new Java front end is very easy to download and install.
Since it is it fully integrated into egcs, you can simply follow the
<a href="http://egcs.cygnus.com/cvs.html">EGCS download and build
instructions</a>.

<p>We have an initial snapshot up for ftp in the 
<a href="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/snapshots/1998-09-06/">EGCS snapshot directory</a>.
GCJ has been integrated into EGCS and it will show up in all future
developer snapshots.

<h2>How to try it</h2>

<p>The source code compiler still needs some work, so we recommend
compiling your source to bytecoded class files using a tradition
bytecode compiler, like <a
href="http://http.cs.berkeley.edu/~engberg/guavac">guavac</a>
(although any compiler should do).  Next, you'll need some libraries.
We intend to release something soon but, until then, the ones from <a
href="http://www.classpath.org">www.classpath.org</a> should do just
fine. To compile <tt>foo.class</tt> to native code, simply set your
<tt>CLASSPATH</tt> environment variable to point to your class
libraries, and run <tt>gcj -o foo.o foo.class</tt>.  Of course,
nothing will link or run yet, but we'll get there! <tt>:-)</tt>
