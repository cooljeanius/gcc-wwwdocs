We're happy to announce public availability of a new GCC based native
code compiler for the Java(TM) language.

The new GNU based compiler, GCJ, compiles both Java source files and
bytecode compiled Java class files to native code for a wide range of
target architectures.

GCJ is a work in progress.  We're also working on the set of runtime
libraries needed for executing GCJ compiled code, and extensions to
GDB, the GNU debugger, for debugging GCJ compiled code.

Full details are available on the GCJ web pages:
