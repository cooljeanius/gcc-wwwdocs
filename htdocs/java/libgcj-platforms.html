<h2> Platform Coverage </h2>
<p>One of the critical steps in making releases is platform testing.  
Since there is no prior release of libgcj to perform regressions against,
we want to compare results against a known building platform, i686-pc-linux-gnu.

<p>We would like to get the widest coverage possible, so please check the
following chart for platforms that have already been covered if you have
a choice of platforms to build upon.

<p>Please send build/test results (in the format described below) to
<a href="mailto:java-discuss@sourceware.cygnus.com">java-discuss@sourceware.cygnus.com</a>.
<br>You may also address questions to 
<a href="mailto:java-discuss@sourceware.cygnus.com">java-discuss@sourceware.cygnus.com</a>
or to indicate that you would like to help in another way with some phase of the
libgcj-2.95 release cycle.

<h2>How to run the regression tests</h2>

<p>  First, you must have built and installed
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/java/libgcj.html">libgcj</a> using the
<b>libgcj-2_95-branch</b> branch of the source.
<p>This can be done by including the <tt>'-rlibgcj-2_95-branch'</tt>
option on the <tt>'cvs co'</tt> command line or downloading the
<a href="ftp://sourceware.cygnus.com/pub/java/snapshots/">snapshot</a>
and then following the
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/java/libgcj.html">
build instructions on the libgcj page</a>.

<p>  Next, go to the <tt>libjava/testsuite</tt> directory of your build
tree and run <tt>'make check'</tt> after doing the following:
<ul>
  <li>In order to more fully exercise libgcj, it is highly recommended to
  include the 
  <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/mauve/">Mauve testsuite</a>
  in the test run.
  <br>The Mauve tests are available for
  <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/mauve/download.html">download</a>
  via both anonymous cvs and snapshots.
  <li>The env variable MAUVEDIR must be set to the top of the Mauve source tree
  <li>In MAUVEDIR, sym link mauve-libgcj from the mauve-libgcj file in the
  libgcj source tree.  E.g.
  <pre>
    ln -s ~/sourceware/libgcj/libjava/mauve-libgcj mauve-libgcj
  </pre>
</ul>

<h2>Testing notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Mauve may fail to build the first time around.
  If this happens, just run <tt>'make check'</tt> again.
  <li>You may also need to include <tt>'KEYS=libgcj'</tt> on the <tt>make</tt>
  line in order to select the appropriate tests for the libgcj project.
  <li> It is highly recommended that you not override the default libgcj
  configuration option for building with dynamic libraries.  This is to avoid
  having to explicitly specify some libgcj object modules on the link line
  to get certain java/net Mauve tests to execute.
</ul>

<h2>Current Platform Testing Status</h2>
<p>This is the current results for the platforms reported to us.  Please use
this format when reporting your results.
<p>

<p>A list of deviations from the 
<a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/libgcj-sum.txt">posted baseline list of test results</a>
should follow any entry you submit.
A context diff is fine if it is clear what tests are failing;
we'd rather not have to deal with a complete output listing unless
it is necessary to comprehend the deviations.
<br>Note that if you are not using POSIX threads, some tests will not complete  
successfully, so differences should be expected.
 
<p>Please send build/test results to
<a href="mailto:java-discuss@sourceware.cygnus.com">java-discuss@sourceware.cygnus.com</a>
in this format.
