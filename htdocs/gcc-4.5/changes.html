<h1>GCC 4.5 Release Series<br />Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Support has been removed for all the 
    <a href="../gcc-4.4/changes.html#obsoleted">configurations obsoleted
    in GCC 4.4</a>.</li>
    <li>Support has been removed for the <code>protoize</code>
    and <code>unprotoize</code> utilities, obsoleted in GCC 4.4.</li>
 </ul>

<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

  <ul>

    <li>The <code>-save-temps</code> now takes an optional argument.  The
    <code>-save-temps</code> and <code>-save-temps=cwd</code> switches write
    the temporary files in the current working directory based on the original
    source file.  The <code>-save-temps=obj</code> switch will write files into
    the directory specified with the <code>-o</code> option, and the
    intermediate filenames are based on the output file.  This will allow the
    user to get the compiler intermediate files when doing parallel builds
    without two builds of the same filename located in different directories
    from interfering with each other.</li>

    <li>Debugging dumps are now created in the same directory as the
    object file rather than in the current working directory.  This
    allows the user to get debugging dumps when doing parallel builds
    without two builds of the same filename interfering with each other.</li>

  </ul>

<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<h3>All languages</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The <code>-fshow-column</code> option is now on by default.  This 
    means error messages now have a column associated with them.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Ada</h3>

<h3>C family</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>If a header named in a <code>#include</code> directive is not
    found, the compiler exits immediately.  This avoids a cascade of
    errors arising from declarations expected to be found in that
    header being missing.</li>
    <li>GCC now implements C90- and C99-conforming rules for constant
    expressions.  This may cause warnings or errors for some code
    using expressions that can be folded to a constant but are not
    constant expressions as defined by ISO C.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>C++</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="cxx0x_status.html">Improved experimental support for
    the upcoming ISO C++ standard, C++0x</a>. Including support
    for <code>explicit</code> type conversion operators.</li>

    <li>When printing the name of a class template specialization, G++ will
    now omit any template arguments which match the default template
    argument for that parameter.  This behavior (and the pretty-printing of
    function template specializations as template signature and arguments)
    can be disabled with the <code>-fno-pretty-templates</code>
    option.</li>

    <li>Access control is now applied to <code>typedef</code> names used in
    a template, which may cause G++ to reject some ill-formed code that was
    accepted by earlier releases.  The <code>-fno-access-control</code>
    flag can be used as a temporary workaround until the code is
    corrected.</li>

  </ul>  
  <h4>Runtime Library (libstdc++)</h4>

<h3>Fortran</h3>

<h3>Java (GCJ)</h3>

<h2 id="targets">New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

<h3>AIX</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Full cross-toolchain support now available with GNU Binutils</li>
  </ul>

<h3>AVR</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The <code>-mno-tablejump</code> option has been removed because it
    has the same effect as the <code>-fno-jump-tables</code> option.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>IA-32/x86-64</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>GCC now supports handling floating-point excess precision
    arising from use of the x87 floating-point unit in a way that
    conforms to ISO C99.  This is enabled
    with <code>-fexcess-precision=standard</code> and with standards
    conformance options such as <code>-std=c99</code>, and may be
    disabled using <code>-fexcess-precision=fast</code>.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>MIPS</h3>

<h3 id="picochip">picochip</h3>

<h2>Documentation improvements</h2>

<h2>Other significant improvements</h2>

<h3>Plugins</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>It is now possible to extend the compiler without having to
    modify its source code.  A new option <code>-fplugin=file.so</code>
    tells GCC to load the shared object <code>file.so</code> and execute
    it as part of the compiler.  The internal documentation describes
    the details on how plugins can interact with the compiler.</li>
  </ul>
