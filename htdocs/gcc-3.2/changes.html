<h1>GCC 3.2 Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<!-- Changes for later point releases should be added at the top. -->

<h2>Additional changes in GCC 3.2.1</h2>

<h3>C/ObjC/C++</h3>

 <ul>
    <li>The method of constructing the list of directories to be searched
	for header files has been revised.  If a directory named by a
	<code>-I</code> option is a standard system include directory,
	the option is ignored to ensure that the default search order
	for system directories and the special treatment of system header
	files are not defeated.</li>
 </ul>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p>See <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2002-08/msg00405.html">this message</a> for 
a list of bugs fixed in this release.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>This GCC release is based on the GCC 3.1 sourcebase, and thus has
    all the <a href="../gcc-3.1/changes.html">changes in the GCC 3.1 series</a>.
    In addition, GCC 3.2 has a number of C++ ABI fixes which make its
    C++ compiler generate binary code which is incompatible with the C++
    compilers found in earlier GCC releases, including GCC 3.1 and
    GCC 3.1.1.</li>
  </ul>


<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<h3>C++</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>There are now no known differences between the C++ ABI
    implemented in GCC and the multi-vendor standard.  We believe that
    the ABI for the C++ standard library is now stable and will not
    change in future versions of the compiler.  However, hard
    experience has taught us to be cautious; it is possible that more
    problems will be found.  It is our intention to make changes to
    the ABI only if they are necessary for correct compilation of C++,
    as opposed to conformance to the ABI documents.</li>

    <li>For details on how to build an ABI compliant compiler for
    GNU/Linux systems, check the <a href="c++-abi.html">common C++ ABI
    page</a>.</li>
  </ul>


<h2>New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

<h3>x86-64</h3>
 
  <ul>
   <li>A bug whereby the compiler could generate bad code for
       <code>bzero</code> has been fixed.</li>
  </ul>
