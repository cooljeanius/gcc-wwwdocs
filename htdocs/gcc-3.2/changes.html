<h1>GCC 3.2 Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The preprocessor no longer accepts multi-line string literals.
      They were deprecated in 3.0 and 3.1.</li>
</ul>


<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>...</li>
  </ul>


  
<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<h3>C/ObjC/C++</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The preprocessor now accepts directives within macro
    arguments.  It processes them just as if they had not been within
    macro arguments.</li>

    <li>The separate ISO preprocessor has been completely removed.
    The front-end handles preprocessed output if necessary.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>C++</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Type based alias analysis has been implemented for C++
    aggregate types. </li>
  </ul>

<h3>Java</h3>

<h3>Fortran</h3>


<h2>New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The HP-PA port now defaults to scheduling for the PA8000 series
        of processors.  Scheduling support for the PA7300 processor has
	been added.</li>
    <li>The SPARC, HP-PA and SH4 ports have been converted to use the DFA
        processor pipeline description.</li>
  </ul>


<h2>Obsolete Targets</h2>


<h2>Documentation improvements</h2>


<h2>Other significant improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A new scheme for accurately describing processor pipelines has been
        added for GCC 3.2 (aka the DFA scheduler).</li>

    <li>Almost all front-end dependencies in the compiler have been
    separated out into a set of language hooks.  This should make
    adding a new front end clearer and easier.</li>

    <li>One effect of removing the separate preprocessor is a small
    increase in the robustness of the compiler in general, and the
    maintainability of target descriptions.  Previously
    target-specific built-in macros and others, such as
    <code>__FAST_MATH__</code>, had to be handled with so-called specs
    that were hard to maintain.  Often they would fail to behave
    properly when conflicting options were supplied on the command
    line, and define macros in the user's namespace even when strict
    ISO compliance was requested.  Integrating the preprocessor has
    cleanly solved these issues.</li>
  </ul>
