<h1>GCC 3.2 Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>This GCC release is based on the GCC 3.1 sourcebase, and thus has
    all the <a href="../gcc-3.1/changes.html">changes in the GCC 3.1 series</a>.
    In addition, GCC 3.1 has a number of C++ ABI fixes in it which make its C++
    compiler binary incompatible with the C++ compilers found in earlier GCC
    releases, including GCC 3.1 and GCC 3.1.1.</li>
  </ul>


<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

  
<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<h3>C++</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>The C++ ABI now conforms to the V3 multi-vendor standard.</li>
  </ul>


<h2>New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>


<h2>Documentation improvements</h2>


<h2>Other significant improvements</h2>
