<h1>GCC 3.2 Release Series</h1>

<p>April 25, 2003</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU project</a> and the GCC
developers are pleased to announce the release of GCC 3.2.3.</p>

<p>The purpose of the GCC 3.2 release series is to provide a stable
platform for OS distributors to use building their next releases.  A
primary objective was to stabilize the C++ ABI; we believe that the
interface to the compiler and the C++ standard library are now relatively
stable.</p>

<p>Be aware that C++ code compiled by GCC 3.2.x will (in general) not
interoperate with code compiled by GCC 3.1.1 or earlier.</p>

<p>Please refer to our <a href="changes.html">detailed list of news,
caveats, and bug-fixes</a> for further information.</p>

<p>GCC used to stand for the GNU C Compiler, but since the compiler
supports several other languages aside from C, it now stands for the
GNU Compiler Collection.</p>
