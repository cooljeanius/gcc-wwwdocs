<h1>Local Dead Store Elimination</h1>

<p>January 18, 1999</p>

<p>Christian Bruel and Jeff Law have contributed a significant improvement to
the local dead store elimination performed by GCC.</p>

<p>Previously GCC would not detect a pair of memory stores (dead store
candidates) as dead if they were separated by any memory reference which
did not use the exact same address as the dead store candidates.</p>

<p>GCC now tracks loads and stores more accurately within each basic block.
GCC also uses alias analysis to detect when the dead store candidates can not
reference the same memory locations as the memory references between the
dead store candidates.  This allows more dead stores to be eliminated.</p>

<p>To see the utility of this new optimization, consider the following
function:</p>
<pre>
int t1;
int t2;
void dead_stores ()
{
  t1 += 1 ; t2 += 1;
  t1 += 2 ; t2 += 2;
  t1 += 3 ; t2 += 3; 
}
</pre>
<p>Without the new optimization, the code generated for this function on a
sparc looked like:</p>
<pre>
	sethi %hi(t1),%o3
	ld [%o3+%lo(t1)],%g2
	sethi %hi(t2),%o4
	ld [%o4+%lo(t2)],%g3
	add %g2,1,%o0
	st %o0,[%o3+%lo(t1)]
	add %g3,1,%o1
	st %o1,[%o4+%lo(t2)]
	add %g2,3,%o2
	add %g3,3,%o0
	st %o2,[%o3+%lo(t1)]
	st %o0,[%o4+%lo(t2)]
	add %g2,6,%g2
	add %g3,6,%g3
	st %g2,[%o3+%lo(t1)]
	retl
	st %g3,[%o4+%lo(t2)]
</pre>
<p>With the optimization, the code generated for the function looks like:</p>
<pre>
	sethi %hi(t1),%o0
	sethi %hi(t2),%o1
	ld [%o0+%lo(t1)],%g2
	ld [%o1+%lo(t2)],%g3
	add %g2,6,%g2
	add %g3,6,%g3
	st %g2,[%o0+%lo(t1)]
	retl
	st %g3,[%o1+%lo(t2)]
</pre>

<p>Note that 4 store operations have been eliminated. Elimination of those
store operations also allows 4 add operations to be eliminated.</p>
