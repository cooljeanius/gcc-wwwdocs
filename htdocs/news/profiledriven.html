<h1>Infrastructure for Profile Driven Optimizations</h1>

<p>August 29, 2001</p>


<p>Jan Hubicka, SuSE Labs, together with Richard Henderson, Red Hat, and
Andreas Jaeger, SuSE Labs, has contributed infrastructure for profile
driven optimizations.
</p>

<p>
In numerous cases, the optimizations performed by a compiler trade
one objective for another one, for instance size for speed, or speed
in one execution path for speed on other.  Poor choices on
such decisions may lead to programs that are even bigger and slower
than if compiled with a less sophisticated compiler.
</p>

<p> To assist optimizers in those decisions, it is useful to have
information about the runtime behavior of a program (expected
probabilities of branches and frequencies of executions of given
program blocks) - the so called program profile.  Jan Hubicka has
extended GCC so that profile information is more readily available to
various optimizers in GCC and modified some existing optimizers to use
this information.
</p>

<h2>Profile feedback</h2>

<p>
The most natural way to determine a program profile is to compile an
instrumented program, execute it, store the information about the
runtime behavior and then recompile it again reading the data
back into the compiler.  GCC has had this feature for several years now,
originally contributed by James E. Wilson and Bob Manson, Cygnus
Support.
</p>

<p> This information has not been widely used by the compiler - until
GCC version 3.0 it has been only used to generate branch prediction
hints for some architectures. GCC 3.0 also uses it for the basic
block reordering pass.  Both optimization passes only used information
about branch direction, but not about the frequency of execution of a
basic block.  The latter information could not be used since it was
not directly available to these passes and subsequent optimization
passes destroyed the profile.
</p>

<p> The first contribution to this project was to revamp large parts
of the GCC backend to maintain a consistent copy of the control flow
graph so that all optimization passes can easily get correct profile
information.  As part of this rework, the jump optimization pass has
been rewritten.  The new jump optimization should be faster and easier
to maintain and also perform more simplifications.  The profiler has
been revamped too and execution counts are now attached directly to
the basic block and edges.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, the profile counters now use 64-bit, so they do not
overflow on fast 32-bit machines (this affects the gcov utility too)
and several bugs have been fixed.
</p>

<h2>Static program profile</h2>

<p> A major problem of profile driven optimization is ease of
use. Users are required to compile their program twice.  Additionally,
designing good training runs is a complex issue and nearly impossible
for some programs.  As this issue is very important for GCC -
commonly used for open source development - we took great care to
provide an alternative.
</p>

<p> GCC contains a static branch predictor which is able to guess the common
direction of any branch without an experimental run based on <a
href="#1">[1]</a>. The predictor consists of a set of simple
heuristics that expose common behavior of programs, for instance that
loops usually loop more than once, pointers are non-null and integers
usually positive.  The original predictor has been contributed by <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/news/reorder.html">Stan Cox and Jason
Eckhardt for the basic block reordering pass</a>.
</p>

<p> For this project the predictor has been extended to use
Dempster-Shaffer theory <a href="#2">[2]</a> to combine the used
heuristics to give the expected branch probability and a new mechanism
has been added for other optimization passes of GCC to annotate
branches.  For instance, the loop optimizer is sometimes able to
compute the exact number of iterations of a given loop and now it can
add the prediction, so the branch predictor will be aware of this
information, too.
</p>

<p> Finally, a new pass has been implemented to propagate the edge
probabilities into expected frequencies of executions of the
individual basic blocks, so that the static profile looks identical to
the feedback driven profile for the rest of the compiler.  Wu and
Larus <a href="#2">[2]</a> report that this algorithm can accurately
identify hot spots in a program even at intraprocedural level.
</p>

<h2>Automatic tester</h2>

<p> In order to further analyze the used heuristics, information about
the chosen heuristics is output optionally to a debug file.  The AWK
script <code>analyze_branches</code> (part of GCC's contrib directory)
can be used to compare the guesses with a real profile.  Andreas
Jaeger has set up an automated tester performing daily SPEC2000 runs
with and without profile driven feedback available at <a
href="http://www.suse.de/~aj/SPEC/">http://www.suse.de/~aj/SPEC/</a>.
</p>

<p> While analyzing the branch predictors we discovered some severe
bugs in their implementation, e.g. loop exits had been predicted as
taken.  The result of the <code>analyze_branches</code> script on the
SPECint2000 runs is manually fed back into GCC as basic probabilities
and used thereby to compute the expected outcome of the implemented
heuristics for branches.
</p>

<p> The experimental results show that the current implementation of
branch predictors successfully guesses about 76% of the branches
(compared to 70% reported by <a href="#1">[1]</a>).  About half of the
branches are guessed with 90% success.  A perfect branch predictor
based on the profile feedback guesses 94% of the branches correctly.
</p>

<p> It is natural that the static profile is inferior to the profile
used by a feedback driven compilation.  Feedback driven compilation
produces faster and smaller programs, but the difference is not that
drastic at the moment.  In the case of SPEC2000 integer tests, it
gives an overall difference of about 3%.  We hope to enlarge this gap
in the future by better use of the profile information and by
implementing better static predictors.  As reported in <a
href="#3">[3]</a>, the benefit for real world applications is higher
than for benchmarks, as applications tend to have larger working sets
and benefit more from reduced code size.
</p>

<h2>Optimizations performed</h2>

<p>
The register allocator has been modified to use frequencies to compute
the expected cost for choosing proper register classes and for
computing priorities for the allocation itself.  The experimental runs
have shown that the current register allocator correctly incorporates the new
information and works considerably better than with the original set
of heuristics, especially on register starved architectures, such as
ia32.
</p>

<p>
The reg-stack pass has been enhanced to optimize the common paths of
code at the expense of uncommon paths.  This decreased random peaks
in the benchmark results, but did not bring as large improvements as
the previous change.
</p>

<p> Code alignment decisions are now based on profile information,
avoiding useless alignment of infrequently executed regions, e.g. loops
that iterate only a few times.  For i386, the savings is about 7%
of final executable size.
</p>

<p>
The basic block reordering and if-conversion passes, which already
made use of probability information, benefit from more accurate
information.
</p>

<h2>Future work</h2>

<p> Still there are some patches awaiting review: A patch for better
choice between slow and small or big and fast prologue/epilogue code
on i386 and x86-64 architectures and also some small improvements to
the branch prediction algorithms.
</p>

<p> A number of further optimizations are possible. For instance <a
href="#3">[3]</a> describes superblock formation, loop peeling, loop
inlining and some other minor optimizations.  Work continues on a
separate branch to introduce better infrastructure for control flow
graph manipulation (such as code duplication) that will make
implementing such optimizations easier.
</p>

<p>
It would also be nice to modify the current loop optimizer to preserve
the flow graph and use this information to control the optimizations
performed, such as loop unrolling, peeling or strength reduction <a
href="#8">[8]</a>, <a href="#3">[3]</a>.
</p>

<p>
The splitting, peephole2 and final passes can be modified to produce
smaller code in infrequently executed parts of functions to avoid code
bloat and cache pollution.
</p>

<p> The basic block reordering algorithm can be considerably improved
and extended for code replication, as described in <a
href="#5">[5]</a> and <a href="#6">[6]</a>, to optimize branch
prediction, cache and instruction fetch performance.
</p>

<p> The predicated execution framework can be used for hyperblock
formation <a href="#8">[8]</a> and possible reverse if-conversion <a
href="#9">[9]</a> on architectures not supporting predicated
execution.
</p>

<p> There is room from improvement in branch prediction. Patterson
describes branch prediction using an improved value range propagation
pass <a href="#4">[4]</a> that has significantly better accuracy.  A
number of other simple heuristics can be added.
</p>

<p>
The basic block profiler needs to be extended to work for multi-threaded
programs.
</p>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p> Richard Henderson has done some excellent work on reviewing all
patches, sending lots of valuable suggestions and helping to fix a
number of problems created by the control-flow graph revamp and jump
pass rewrite.  He also contributed the if-conversion pass replacing
lots of functionality of the original jump pass and the new CFG
infrastructure.  Without his contributions this project would have
been much more difficult, if not impossible.
</p>

<p> Jan Hubicka contributed the patches to GCC including
the <code>analyze_branches</code> script.
</p>

<p>
Andreas Jaeger has created the automatic tester based on
scripts written by Diego Novillo, Red Hat, for his SPEC95 tester. Such
testers are an important step to increase code quality in future GCC
releases.  For more information about these testers, check <a
