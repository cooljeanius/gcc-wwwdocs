<h1 align="center">Inlining Improvements</h1>

<p>December 5, 1999</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that <A
HREF="http://www.codesourcery.com">CodeSourcery, LLC</A>, as part of a
continuing contract with the Accelerated Strategic Computing
Initiative (ASCI) program at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, has
contributed a new inliner for C++.</p>

<p>This inliner works at an earlier phase of the compiler than the
traditional GCC inliner.  As a result, the compiler may use
dramatically less time and memory to compile programs that make heavy
use of templates, such as C++ expression-template programs. One
program that previously required 247MB of memory to compile, and about
six minutes of compile time, now takes only 157MB and about two
minutes to compile.  Although this inliner currently only works on C++
code, we expect that it will soon be used in C, Java, and other
languages as well.</p>

<p>In addition, the new inliner may occasionally generate somewhat
better code since more high-level information is available to
optimizers.  In the future, the new inliner will be used to facilitate
a number of new optimizations, like scattering and gathering of loads
and stores.  In addition, further compile-time memory and speed
improvements are likely through simplifications of the code after
inlining.  These optimizations will greatly reduce the C++
"abstraction penalty" and improve the usability of the GNU C++
compiler.</p>
