<h1>Localized Register Spilling</h1>

<p>October 27, 1998</p>

<p>Bernd Schmidt has contributed code to implement localized register spilling
for GCC.  Bernd's code complements the major improvements Joern Rennecke has
made to reload inheritance over the last few months.  Together, they can
greatly decrease the costs associated with spilling registers due to the
compiler running out of machine registers.</p>

<p>GCC's register allocators attempt to pack pseudo registers, which are
potentially unbounded in number, into the register set provided by a
particular target machine.  Pseudo registers which have non-overlapping
lifetimes may be allocated to the same machine register.  Furthermore, each
pseudo has exactly one home, either a machine register or a stack slot.</p>

<p>If the register spilling/reloading pass of the compiler needs a particular
machine register for a reload, then pseudos allocated that that machine
register may need to be spilled (ie, deallocated from that machine register and
either reassigned to another free register or moved into the stack).</p>

<p> Previously, GCC would spill <b> every pseudo </b> which has allocated to
that machine register.  Even though only one such pseudo could ever hold a
live value at the location where the reload was needed.</p>

<p>With Bernd's work, GCC is able to only spill the pseudo that is live at
the point where the reload is needed.  This significantly reduces the number of
pseudos which get spilled into the stack and as a result can significantly
improve code for register poor machines such as the x86.</p>

<p>One side effect of Bernd's work is that incorrect asms which explicitly
clobber a register that is also mentioned in the inputs/outputs for the
asm will always generate an error on all ports.  This is going to cause linux
kernels to fail to build on x86 processors until the linux kernel developers
fix the asms in the linux kernel.</p>

<p>Joern's reload inheritance improvements are designed to optimize away
redundant loads, stores, copies and address computations that are created due
to register reloading and spilling.  Thus, Bernd's patches reduce the amount
of spilling and reloading that is performed and Joern's patches try to optimize
any spills and reloads that Bernd's patches could not avoid.</p>
