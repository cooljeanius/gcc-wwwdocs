<h1 align="center">Global Null Pointer Test Elimination</h1>

<p>September 20, 1999

<p>We are pleased to announce that Cygnus Solutions has donated a global null
pointer test elimination pass to GCC.

<p>If all paths to a null pointer test use the same pointer in a memory
load/store, then the pointer must have a non-null value at the test.
Otherwise, one of the load/stores leading to the test would have faulted.

<p>The optimizer computes which blocks have loads/stores using a register
as the memory address and in which the register is not potentially reset
to zero before the end of the block.  The optimizer also computes what blocks
can potentially set a register to a zero value.

<p>That information is propagated through the function's cfg to provide
a global view of what registers are known to have non-null values at the
start and end of each basic block.

<p>The optimizer then examines each basic block to determine if it ends
with a null pointer test and whether or not the register tested is known
to have a non-null value.

<p>It is important to realize the compiler does not care what value is in
the reigster, only whether or not the register is known to have a non-null
value.

<p>Here is a trivial example showing the value of this optimization.
<pre>
foo (char *x)
{
  char ret = *x;

  if (x)
    com();
  else
    bar ();
  return ret;
}

	Before				After
foo:
        pushl   %ebp			pushl   %ebp
        movl    %esp, %ebp		movl    %esp, %ebp
        subl    $20, %esp		subl    $20, %esp
        pushl   %ebx			pushl   %ebx
        movl    8(%ebp), %eax		movl    8(%ebp), %eax
        movb    (%eax), %bl		movsbl  (%eax),%ebx
        testl   %eax, %eax
        je      .L3
        call    com			call    com
        jmp     .L4
        .p2align 4,,7
.L3:
        call    bar
.L4:
        movsbl  %bl,%eax		movl    %ebx, %eax
        popl    %ebx			popl    %ebx
        movl    %ebp, %esp		movl    %ebp, %esp
        popl    %ebp			popl    %ebp
        ret				ret

</pre>

<p>Note how the compiler eliminated the test instruction and the entire
else arm of the if/else conditional.
