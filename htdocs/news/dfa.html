<h1>DFA Scheduler</h1>

<p>We are pleased to announce that Vladimir Makarov, of <a
href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat</a>, has contributed support
for using Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) to describe structural
hazards in processor pipelines to the instruction scheduler.   This
work is based on literature from various sources, including, but not
limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Efficient Instruction Scheduling Using Finite State Automata.
      Bala and Rubin, MICRO-28.</li>
  <li>Employing Finite State Automata for Resource Scheduling.
      Muller, MICRO-26.</li>
  <li>Detecting Pipeline Structural Hazards Quickly.
      Proebsting and Fraser, POPL '94.</li>
</ul>


<p>The instruction scheduler is responsible for reordering instructions
based on data, control and structural hazards to improve performance.
The current scheduler models the pipeline of the target processor using
information such as the number and type of functional units as well
as the latency and throughput of those units.  An instruction is scheduled
to execute when it is the highest priority instruction with no pending
hazards.  More accurate modeling of the processor pipeline can ultimately
result in better performance of the generated code.</p>

<p>The existing model works well, but has limitations.  For example, describing
processors with similar, but not 100% identical pipelines is difficult
at best.  While these pipelines can be modeled, it is extremely non-intuitive.
Consider <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2002-05/msg00199.html">this message
from the GCC mailing lists.</a>  As others pointed out later, the
pipeline description for the PPro/P2/P3 pipelines is purposefully inaccurate
and marks instructions which only use P0 as also using P01 to avoid
over-subscribing the P01 units.</p>

<p>The DFA model can also accurately describe resources that are used at
different times during the overall lifetime of an instruction.   So, 
for example, using a DFA description we could model a hazard caused
by two classes of instructions retiring at the same time in an out of
order execution machine.</p>

<p>The DFA model allows for extremely fast recognition of structural
hazards.  This allows the compiler to efficiently try multiple schedules
to maximize issue throughput for example.  This can be particularly
important on large superscalar, VLIW, and EPIC architectures.</p>

<p>The DFA model can accurately describe packing of multiple operations
into instruction words.  Thus it can be used to handle creation of
VLIW and EPIC instruction words.</p>

<p>By building both the DFA an the reverse DFA it is possible to build a
scheduler which can verify replacement of instructions does not 
introduce any new hazards or lengthen a schedule.  The ability to 
perform these verifications can be extremely helpful in building 
software pipeliners or in building schedules for VLIW processors.</p>


<p>We would like to thank the following individual contributors who
have worked on the DFA code or on processor descriptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vladimir Makarov of Red Hat for building the base DFA
      implementation.</li>
  <li>Naveen Sharma of HCL Technologies for building a DFA description for
      the SH4.</li>
  <li>Richard Henderson of Red Hat for DFA descriptions for the Alpha
      processor family.</li>
  <li>Jeff Law of Red Hat for DFA descriptions for the HP-PA processor
      family.</li>
  <li>David Miller of Red Hat for DFA descriptions for the SPARC processor
      family.</li>
  <li>Jan Hubicka of SuSE for a DFA description for the Pentium
      processor.</li>
  <li>Other contributors will be added here as new DFA descriptions are
      integrated.  DFA descriptions exist in one form or another for
      various members of the IA-32, MIPS, PPC, FRV, IA-64 and other
      processor families.</p>
