<h1>Control Flow Infrastructure</h1>

<p>February 26, 1998</p>

<p>Richard Henderson of Cygnus Solutions has donated a major
rewrite of the control flow analysis pass in the compiler.</p>

<p>The fundamental goal of this rewrite is to provide data structures to
represent the control flow graph that are more easily manipulated by
optimization passes in the compiler.</p>

<p>The rewrite consists of building and maintaining two primary data
structures, basic blocks and control edges between basic blocks.
Each data structure contains information about the block/edge, pointers
to the other data structure and the ability to attach pass specific
information to either blocks or edges.</p>

<p>That basic framework makes certain analysis much easier, such as
control dependence analysis, which is used by aggressive dead code
elimination algorithms.</p>

<p>The basic framework also includes routines to allow global optimizers
to insert instructions onto an edge in the flow graph.  This is a key
operation in global optimizers to expose maximum redundancies and to
find optimal insertion points for expressions in the flow graph.</p>
