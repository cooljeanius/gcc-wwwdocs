<h1 align="center">A New ia32 Backend</h1>

<p>June 15, 1999</p>

<p>On behalf of Cygnus, I am pleased to be able to donate a new back end
for the IA-32 architecture.  The work was done under contract to Intel,
and focused on better optimization for the Pentium II core.</p>

<p>Central to this goal is a more accurate machine description:</p>

<ul>
<li>No more cc0, but instead an explicit flags register.  This allows
    the scheduler more freedom wrt placement of comparison instructions.
    It allows combine to search for places where arithmetic obviates the
    need for an explicit compare, rather than leaving things to chance.

<li>Instruction selection is done in full view of the scheduler.  Previously,
    we would do instruction selection at assembly output time, and the
    scheduler was only give approximations, limiting its effectiveness.
    With the more accurate information, it is able to bundle instructions
    into the 4-1-1 uop sequences that the Pentium II's decoders like to see.
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are a few generic optimizations:</p>

<ul>
<li>An rtl-based peephole pass that is run before sched2.  In addition
    to replacing sequences of instructions, it is also able to find 
    free registers and allocate them as scratches.  This is a generalization
    of the PGCC -friscify pass.

<li>Recognition of extension-dependant GIVs.  This shows up in a loop like
<pre>
        short s;
        for (s = 0; s < 10; ++s)
          array[s] = 0;
</pre>
    When performing the address arithmetic on `array', we must sign-extend
    `s' from a short to a ptrdiff_t.  Previously when seeing the extension,
    we would just throw up our hands and not optimize.

<li>Recognition of certain forms of loop-carried post-decrement.  Primarily,
<pre>
        while (a--) { /* nothing dependant on a */ }
</pre>
    becomes
<pre>
        if (a) do { ... } while (--a);
</pre>

    which removes a temporary and is friendlier to the register allocator.

<li>Reorganize certain forms of (A*B)+(C*D) that occur in multidimensional
    array access.  This will become ((A*B')+(C*D'))*F, where F is a power
    of two factor in common to B and D.  This allows better use of scaled
    index addressing modes, and generally better GIV combination.
</ul>

<p>The work was done primarily by Bob Manson and myself between November 1998
and April 1999.  Ulrich Drepper, Stan Cox, and Andrew Haley provided enormous
help in isolating code generation problems.</p>

<p>Because we branched so long ago, and the gcc project has been moving so
rapidly, the merge process will not be simple.  Diffs taken from the branch
do not apply cleanly, and there are changes that have gone into gcc that
should not be lost in the transition.</p>

<p>That the patches don't apply directly is actually a good thing.  The code
should be peer-reviewed, which is easily done concurrently with fixing up
patch problems.</p>

<p>So: I've put the code out on 
<a href="ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/snapshots/p2/p2-19990615.tar.bz2">
ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/snapshots/p2/p2-19990615.tar.bz2</a></p>

<p>The files d-p2-raw-* are diffs directly out of cvs, which is kind
of confusing because different things went in to different branches
at different times.  I'm fairly sure I got it all.</p>

<p>The file d-p2-pass0 is a first pass approximation at applying the
patches to egcs mainline.  It compiles, but I guarantee it does not
work -- it segv's building libgcc2.</p>

<p>Because of the massive changes, reg-stack.c, and i386.* are the
complete files off the branch.  This should help figuring out what
to do with some of the egcs changes since the branch was created.</p>

<p>Over the coming weeks, I will appreciate your help in cleaning up
this code so that it can go into gcc mainline.  Optimistically, I
think we could have this done by August 1.  However, I do not want
this to impact the gcc 2.95 release process, so if we have to put
the merge aside temporarily, so be it.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
