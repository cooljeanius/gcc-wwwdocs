<h1 align="center">libgcj Announcement</h1>

<p>April 7, 1999

<p>We are very pleased to announce the public release of libgcj, the
run-time component of GCJ, the GNU Compiler for Java.  This allows you
to build executable programs from Java source, without needing any JDK
components.

<p>Libgcj includes the core run-time environment, such as object
management, garbage collection, thread support.  It also includes the
core Java classes from java.lang, java.util, and parts of java.io,
java.net, and java.text.  Many things (such as object serialization,
java.awt, java.util.zip, and most of java.lang.reflect) are not yet
implemented.

<p>Libgcj is licensed under the terms of the LGPL; see the file
COPYING.LIB for details.

<p>gdb 4.18, to be released very soon, is Java-aware and can debug
Gcj-compiled programs.  This release means that there is a complete
suite of free software tools for compiled Java.

<p>For instructions on downloading and installation, and for more
information on gcj and libgcj in general, see the Gcj and Libgcj
homepage at
