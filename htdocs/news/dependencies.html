<h1 align="center">Dependency Generation Improvements</h1>

<p>22 January 2001</p>

<p>The following is a brief summary of the improvements made to the
preprocessor's Makefile dependency generation functionality.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Consider the simple example of a file <code>test.c</code>
  that includes the file <code>test.h</code>, and the command line</p>

  <pre>
	/usr/bin/gcc -MD -c test.c -o subdir/bar.o
  </pre>

  <p>With previous versions of CPP, this command line would leave a
  file <code>test.d</code> in the current directory, and its contents
  would be</p>

  <pre>
	test.o: test.c test.h
  </pre>

  <p>which is pretty useless.  The latest versions of CPP instead do
  what you probably want - they make the target
  <code>subdir/bar.o</code>, place the dependency file in the same
  directory as the object file, and name it after the object file.
  Thus in the file <code>subdir/bar.d</code> you will find</p>

  <pre>
	subdir/bar.o: test.c test.h
  </pre>

  <li><p>By default CPP uses the main file name, excluding any path, and
  appends the object suffix, normally ``.o'', to it to obtain the name
  of the target for dependency generation.  With <code>-MT</code> or
  <code>-MQ</code> you can specify a target yourself, overriding the
  default one.</p>

  <p>If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
  argument to a switch, or use multiple switches.  The targets you
  specify are output in the order they appear on the command line.
  <code>-MQ</code> is identical to <code>-MT</code>, except that the
  target name is quoted for Make, but with <code>-MT</code> it isn't.
  For example, <code>-MT '$(objpfx)foo.o'</code> gives</p>

  <pre>
	$(objpfx)foo.o: /tmp/foo.c
  </pre>

  but <code>-MQ '$(objpfx)foo.o'</code> gives

  <pre>
	$$(objpfx)foo.o: /tmp/foo.c
  </pre>

  The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
  <code>-MQ</code>.</p>

  <li><p>When used with <code>-M</code> or <code>-MM</code>,
  <code>-MF</code> specifies a file to write the dependencies to.
  This allows the preprocessor to write the preprocessed file to
  stdout normally.  If no <code>-MF</code> switch is given, and one is
  not implied by <code>-MD</code> or <code>-MMD</code>, CPP sends the
  rules to stdout and suppresses normal preprocessed output.</p>

  <li><p>Finally, <code>-MP</code> instructs CPP to add a phony target
  for each dependency other than the main file, causing each to depend
  on nothing.  These dummy rules work around errors <code>make</code>
  gives if you remove header files without updating the
  <code>Makefile</code> to match.</p>

  <p>This is typical output:-</p>

  <pre>
test.o: /tmp/test.c /tmp/test.h

/tmp/test.h:
  </pre>
</ul>
