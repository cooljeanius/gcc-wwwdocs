<h1>GCC 4.4 Release Series<br />Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><code>__builtin_stdarg_start</code> has been completely
    removed from GCC.  Support for <code>&lt;varargs.h&gt;</code> had
    been deprecated since GCC 4.0.  Use
    <code>__builtin_va_start</code> as a replacement.  </li>

    <li>Some of the errors issued by the C++ front end that could be
    downgraded to warnings in previous releases by using
    <code>-fpermissive</code> are now warnings by default. They can be
    converted into errors by using <code>-pedantic-errors</code>.</li>

    <li>Use of the cpp assertion extension will now emit a warning
    when <code>-Wdeprecated</code> or <code>-pedantic</code> is used.
    This extension has been deprecated for many years, but never
    warned about.</li>

    <li>The MIPS port no longer recognizes the <code>h</code>
    <code>asm</code> constraint.  It was necessary to remove
    this constraint in order to avoid generating unpredictable
    code sequences.

    <p>One of the main uses of the <code>h</code> constraint
    was to extract the high part of a multiplication on
    64-bit targets.  For example:</p>
    <pre>
    asm ("dmultu\t%1,%2" : "=h" (result) : "r" (x), "r" (y));</pre>
    <p>You can now achieve the same effect using 128-bit types:</p>
    <pre>
    typedef unsigned int uint128_t __attribute__((mode(TI)));
    result = ((uint128_t) x * y) >> 64;</pre>
    <p>The second sequence is better in many ways.  For example,
    if <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are constants, the
    compiler can perform the multiplication at compile time.
    If <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are not constants,
    the compiler can schedule the runtime multiplication
    better than it can schedule an <code>asm</code> statement.</p>
    </li>

    <li><p>Support for a number of older systems and recently
    unmaintained or untested target ports of GCC has been declared
    obsolete in GCC 4.4.  Unless there is activity to revive them, the
    next release of GCC will have their sources permanently
    <strong>removed</strong>.</p>

    <p>The following ports for individual systems on particular
    architectures have been obsoleted:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Generic a.out on IA32 and m68k (i[34567]86-*-aout*,
        m68k-*-aout*)</li>
      <li>Generic COFF on ARM, H8300, IA32, m68k and SH (arm-*-coff*,
        armel-*-coff*, h8300-*-*, i[34567]86-*-coff*, m68k-*-coff*,
        sh-*-*).  This does not affect other more specific targets
        using the COFF object format on those architectures, or the
        more specific H8300 and SH targets (h8300-*-rtems*,
        h8300-*-elf*, sh-*-elf*, sh-*-symbianelf*, sh-*-linux*,
        sh-*-netbsdelf*, sh-*-rtems*, sh-wrs-vxworks).</li>
      <li>IRIX on MIPS (mips-sgi-irix[56]*)</li>
      <li>2BSD on PDP-11 (pdp11-*-bsd)</li>
      <li>AIX 4.1 and 4.2 on PowerPC (rs6000-ibm-aix4.[12]*,
        powerpc-ibm-aix4.[12]*)</li>
    </ul>

    </li>

    <li>The <code>protoize</code> and <code>unprotoize</code>
    utilities have been obsoleted and will be removed in GCC 4.5.
    These utilities have not been installed by default since GCC
    3.0.</li>

 </ul>

<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A new command-line switch <code>-ftree-switch-conversion</code> has
      been added.  This new pass turns simple initializations of scalar
      variables in switch statements into initializations from a static array,
      given that all the values are known at compile time and the ratio between
      the new array size and the original switch branches does not exceed 
      the parameter <code>--param switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</code> 
      (default is eight).  </li>
  </ul>

<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<h3>C family</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>A new <code>optimize</code> attribute was added to allow programmers to
    change the optimization level and particular optimization options for an
    individual function.  You can also change the optimization options via the
    <code>GCC optimize</code> pragma for functions defined after the pragma.  The
    <code>cold</code> attribute now turns on the <code>-Os</code> optimization
    option and <code>hot</code> attribute turns on the <code>-O3</code>
    optimization option.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>C++</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="cxx0x_status.html">Improved experimental support for the upcoming
    ISO C++ standard, C++0x</a>, including support for inline namespaces.</li>

    <li> Those errors that may be downgraded to warnings to build
    legacy code now mention <code>-fpermissive</code> when
    <code>-fdiagnostics-show-option</code> is enabled.</li>

  </ul>
  
  <h4>Runtime Library (libstdc++)</h4>

<h3>Fortran</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>GNU Fortran now employs libcpp directly instead of using cc1 as an
    external preprocessor. The <a
    href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/Preprocessing-Options.html">
    <code>-cpp</code></a> option was added to allow manual invocation of the
    preprocessor without relying on filename extensions.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Java (GCJ)</h3>

<h2>New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

<h3>AVR</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added support for these new AVR devices:
      <ul>
        <li>ATtiny13A</li>
        <li>ATtiny167</li>
        <li>ATmega32C1</li>
        <li>ATmega32M1</li>
        <li>ATmega32U4</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Removed support for the AVR device ATmega32HVB.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>IA-32/x86-64</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for Intel AES built-in functions and code generation are
	available via <code>-maes</code>.</li>
    <li>Support for Intel PCLMUL built-in function and code generation are
	available via <code>-mpclmul</code>.</li>
    <li>GCC can now utilize the SVML library for vectorizing calls to
	a set of C99 functions if <code>-mveclibabi=svml</code> is specified
	and you link to an SVML ABI compatible library.</li>
    <li>A new <code>option</code> attribute was added to allow programmers to change the target options like <code>-msse2</code> or <code>-march=k8</code> for an individual function.  You can also change the target options via the <code>GCC option</code> pragma for functions defined after the pragma.</li>

  </ul>

<h3>MIPS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for RMI's XLR processor is now available through the
        <code>-march=xlr</code> and <code>-mtune=xlr</code> options.</li>
    <li>64-bit targets can now perform 128-bit multiplications inline,
        instead of relying on a <code>libgcc</code> function.</li>
    <li>Native GNU/Linux toolchains now support <code>-march=native</code>
        and <code>-mtune=native</code>, which select the host processor.</li>
  </ul>
