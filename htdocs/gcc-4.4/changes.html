<h1>GCC 4.4 Release Series<br />Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><code>__builtin_stdarg_start</code> has been completely
    removed from GCC.  Support for <code>&lt;varargs.h&gt;</code> had
    been deprecated since GCC 4.0.  Use
    <code>__builtin_va_start</code> as a replacement.  </li>

    <li> Some of the errors of the C++ front end that may be
    downgraded to warnings by using <code>-fpermissive</code> are now
    warnings by default. They can be converted into errors by using
    <code>-pedantic-errors</code>.</li>

 </ul>

<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>


<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<h3>C family</h3>

<h3>C++</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="cxx0x_status.html">Improved experimental support for the upcoming
    ISO C++ standard, C++0x</a>, including support for inline namespaces.</li>

    <li> Those errors that may be downgraded to warnings to support
    legacy code now mention <code>-fpermissive</code> when
    <code>-fdiagnostics-show-option</code> is enabled.</li>

  </ul>
