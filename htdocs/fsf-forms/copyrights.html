<H2>Copyrights</H2>

<P>
For the sake of registering the copyright on later versions of the
software, you need to keep track of each person who makes significant
changes.  A change of ten lines or so, or a few such changes, in a
large program is not significant.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Before</STRONG> incorporating significant changes, make sure that person
has signed copyright papers and that the Free Software Foundation has
received and signed them.

</P>
<P>
To check whether papers have been received, look in
<TT>`/gd/gnuorg/copyright.list'</TT>.  If you can't look there directly,
<CODE>fsf-records@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE> can check for you, and can also
check for papers that are waiting to be entered and inform you
when expected papers arrive.

</P>
<P>
In order for the contributor to know person should sign papers, you need
to ask for the necessary papers.  If you don't know per well, and you
don't know that person is used to our ways of handling copyright papers,
then it might be a good idea to raise the subject with a message like
this:

</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Would you be willing to assign the copyright to the Free Software
Foundation, so that we could install it in @enddots{}
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
or

</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Would you be willing to sign a copyright disclaimer to put this change
in the public domain, so that we can install it in @enddots{}
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If person wants more information, you can send per
<TT>`<a href="conditions.text">/gd/gnuorg/conditions.text</a>'</TT>, which explains per options (assign
vs. disclaim) and their consequences.

</P>
<P>
Once the conversation is under way and the contributor is ready for more
details, you should send one of the templates that are found in
<TT>`/gd/gnuorg'</TT>.  This section explains which templates you should use
in which circumstances.  <STRONG>Please don't use any of the templates
except for those listed here, and please don't change the wording.</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
Once the conversation is under way, you can send the contributor the
precise wording and instructions by email.  Before you do this, make
sure to get the current version of the template you will use!  We change
these templates occasionally--don't keep using an old version.

</P>
<P>
For large changes, ask the person for an assignment.  Send the person a
copy of the file <TT>`<a href="assign.changes">/gd/gnuorg/assign.changes</a>'</TT>, but first, go to the
second page and insert per name and the name of the program involved in
place of <SAMP>`NAME OF PERSON'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`NAME OF PROGRAM'</SAMP>.  Do this
before sending, because otherwise person might sign without noticing
them.  Then the papers would be useless.

</P>
<P>
For medium to small changes, ask per to fill out and return the
disclaimer in the file <TT>`<a href="disclaim.changes">/gd/gnuorg/disclaim.changes</a>'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If the contributor is likely to keep making changes, person might want
to sign an assignment for all per future changes to the program.  So it
is useful to offer per that alternative.  If person is interested, send
per the template in <TT>`<a href="assign.future">/gd/gnuorg/assign.future</a>'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Before signing this, person needs to ask per employer for a
disclaimer-in-advance; the template for this is in
<TT>`<a href="disclaim.future">/gd/gnuorg/disclaim.future</a>'</TT>, so you should send that file as well
as <TT>`<a href="assign.future">assign.future</a>'</TT>.  (It is more convenient to send them in
separate messages.)

</P>
<P>
We need legal papers for changes in manuals as well as for changes in
software.  For smaller changes, use
<TT>`<a href="disclaim.changes.manual">/gd/gnuorg/disclaim.changes.manual</a>'</TT>; for larger ones, use
<TT>`<a href="assign.changes.manual">/gd/gnuorg/assign.changes.manual</a>'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
If a contributor is reluctant to sign an assignment for a large change,
and is willing to sign a disclaimer instead, that is acceptable, so you
should offer this alternative if it seems useful.  While we prefer an
assignment for a larger change, so that we can enforce the GNU GPL for
the new text, a disclaimer is enough to let us use the text.

</P>
<P>
If you maintain a collection of programs, occasionally someone will
contribute an entire separate program or manual that should be added to
the collection.  Then you can use the files <TT>`<a href="assign.program">assign.program</a>'</TT>,
<TT>`<a href="disclaim.program">disclaim.program</a>'</TT>, <TT>`<a href="assign.manual">assign.manual</a>'</TT>, and
<TT>`<a href="disclaim.manual">disclaim.manual</a>'</TT>.  We very much prefer an assignment for a new
separate program or manual, unless it is quite small, but a disclaimer
is sufficient to let us use the work.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Although there are other templates besides the ones listed here,
they are for special circumstances; please do not use them without
getting advice from Richard Stallman.</STRONG>

</P>
<P>
If you are not sure what to do, then please ask Richard Stallman for
advice; if the contributor asks you questions about the meaning and
consequences of the legal papers, and you don't know the answers, you
can forward them to Stallman.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>Please do not try changing the wording of a template yourself.
If you think a change is needed, please talk with Richard Stallman, who
will work with a lawyer to decide what to do.</STRONG>
