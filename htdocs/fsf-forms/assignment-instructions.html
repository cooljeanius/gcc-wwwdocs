<h1>Instructions for copyright assignment paper</h1>

<p>The way to assign copyright to the Foundation is to sign an
assignment contract.  This is what legally makes the FSF the copyright
holder so that we can register the copyright on the new version.  I'm
assuming that you wrote these changes yourself; if other people wrote
parts, we may need papers from them.

<p>If you are employed to do programming (even at a university), or
have made an agreement with your employer or school saying it owns
programs you write, then you and we need a signed piece of paper from
your employer disclaiming rights to the program.

<p>The disclaimer should be signed by a vice president or general
manager of the company.  If you can't get at them, anyone else
authorized to license software produced there will do.  Here is a
sample wording:

<blockquote>
  Digital Stimulation Corporation hereby disclaims all copyright interest
  in the changes and enhancements made by Hugh Heffner to the program
  "seduce", also including any future revisions of these changes and
  enhancements.

  <p>Digital Stimulation Corporation affirms that it has no other
  intellectual property interest that would undermine this release, or
  the use of the Program, and will do nothing to undermine it in the
  future.

  <p><i>&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;</i>, 1 April 1987
  <br>Ty Coon, President of Vice, Digital Stimulation Corp.
</blockquote>

<p>(If your employer says they do have an intellectual property claim
that could conflict with the use of the program, then please put me in
touch with a suitable representative of the company, so that we can
negotiate what to do about it.)

<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> When you talk to your employer, <b>*no matter what
instructions they have given you*</b>, don't fail to show them the
sample disclaimer above, or a disclaimer with the details filled in for
your specific case.  Companies are usually willing to sign a disclaimer
without any fuss.  If you make your request less specific, you may open
Pandora's box and cause a long and unnecessary delay.

<p><a href="assign.changes">Below is the assignment contract</a> that
we usually use.  You would need to print it out, sign it, and mail it
to:

<p>Richard Stallman
<br>545 Tech Sq rm 425
<br>Cambridge, MA 02139
<br>USA

<p>Please try to print the <a href="assign.changes">whole first page
below</a> on a single piece of paper.  If it doesn't fit on one printed
page, put it on two sides of a single piece of paper.

<p>Don't forget to put down the date when you sign!  Spell out the
month name--don't use a number for the month.  Dates using a number for
the month are ambiguous; 2/8/95 means one thing in the US and another
in Europe.

<p>Be sure to put your name in the place of "NAME OF PERSON" and the name
of the program (e.g. gcc) in the place of "NAME OF PROGRAM".

<p>Mail a copy of the employer's disclaimer as well.

<p>Please send me email about what you decide to do.  If you have any
questions, or would like something to be changed, ask rms@ai.mit.edu
via email.
