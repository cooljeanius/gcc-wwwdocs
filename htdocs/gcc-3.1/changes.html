<h1>GCC 3.1 Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>-traditional</code> C compiler option has been
  deprecated and will be removed in GCC 3.2.  (It remains possible to
  preprocess non-C code with the traditional preprocessor.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>dummy</li>
</ul>

  
<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

<h3>C/C++</h3>

<ul>
<li>A few more <a href="c99status.html">ISO C99 features</a>.</li>
<li>The preprocessor is 10-50% faster than the preprocessor in GCC
    3.0.</li>
<li>The preprocessor's symbol table has been merged with the
    symbol table of the C, C++ and Objective-C front ends.</li>
<li>The preprocessor consumes less memory than the preprocessor in
    GCC 3.0, often significantly so.  On normal input files, it
    typically consumes less memory than pre-3.0 cccp-based GCC,
    too.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Java</h3>

<ul>
<li>libgcj now includes RMI, <code>java.lang.ref.*</code>,
    <code>javax.naming</code>, and <code>javax.transaction</code>.</li>
<li>Property files and other system resources can be compiled into
    executables which use libgcj using the new <code>gcj -R</code>
    feature.</li>
<li>libgcj has been ported to more platforms.  In particular there
    is now a mostly-functional mingw32 target port.</li>
<li>gcj can now use builtins functions for certain known methods,
    for instance <code>Math.cos</code>.  gcj also has a new
    <code>--no-store-checks</code> optimization option.</li>
<li>The following third party interface standards were added to
    libgcj: <code>org.w3c.dom</code> and <code>org.xml.sax</code>.</li>
<li><code>java.security</code> has been merged with GNU
    Classpath. The new package is now JDK 1.2 compliant, and much
    more complete.</li>
<li>A bytecode verifier was added to the libgcj interpreter.</li>
<li><code>java.lang.Character</code> was rewritten to comply with
    the Unicode 3.0 standard.</li>
<li>Partial support for many more locales was added to libgcj.</li>
<li>Fortran improvements are listed in              
    <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/g77_news.html">the Fortran
    documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Hans-Peter Nilsson has contributed a port to <a
    href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix.html">MMIX</a>,
    the CPU architecture used in new editions of Donald E. Knuth's The Art
    of Computer Programming.</li>
    
<li><a href="http://www.axis.com/">Axis Communications</a> has
    contributed its port to the CRIS CPU architecture, used in the ETRAX
    system-on-a-chip series.  See <a
    href="http://developer.axis.com/">Axis' developer site</a> for
    technical information.</li>
    
<li>UltraSPARC is fully supported in 64-bit mode.  The option 
    <code>-m64</code> enables it.</li>
    
<li>The x86 back-end has had some noticeable work done to it.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE Labs</a> developers Jan
      Hubicka, Bo Thorsen and Andreas Jaeger have contributed a port to
      the AMD x86-64 architecture.  For more information on x86-64 see
      <a href="http://www.x86-64.org/">http://www.x86-64.org</a>.</li>
      
      <li>The compiler now supports MMX, 3DNow!, SSE, and SSE2 instructions.
      Options <code>-mmmx</code>, <code>-m3dnow</code>, <code>-msse</code>,
      and <code>-msse2</code> will enable the respective instruction sets.</li>

      <li>Following those improvements, targets for Pentium MMX, K6-2, K6-3,
      Pentium III, Pentium 4, and Athlon 4 Mobile/XP/MP were added.
      Refer to the documentation on <code>-march=</code> and
      <code>-mcpu=</code> options for details.</li>

      <li>For those targets that support it, <code>-mfpmath=sse</code> will
      cause the compiler to generate SSE/SSE2 instructions for floating point
      math instead of x87 instructions.  Usually, this will lead to quicker
      code &mdash; especially on the Pentium 4.</li>

      <li>Prefetch support has been added to the Pentium III, Pentium 4, and
      Athlon series.</li>
   </ul></li>
     
<li>Altivec support has been added for the PowerPC variants that
    support it.  See <code>-maltivec</code>.</li>
</ul>
