<h1>GCC 3.1 Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>-traditional</code> C compiler option has been
  deprecated and will be removed in GCC 3.2.  (It remains possible to
  preprocess non-C code with the traditional preprocessor.)</li>
</ul>


<h2>General Optimizer Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>dummy</li>
  </ul>

  
<h2>New Languages and Language specific improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>A few more <a href="c99status.html">ISO C99 features</a>.</li>
    <li>The preprocessor is 10-50% faster than the preprocessor in GCC
        3.0.</li>
    <li>The preprocessor's symbol table has been merged with the
        symbol table of the C, C++ and Objective-C front ends.</li>
    <li>The preprocessor consumes less memory than the preprocessor in
        GCC 3.0, often significantly so.  On normal input files, it
        typically consumes less memory than pre-3.0 cccp-based GCC,
        too.</li>

    <li>libgcj now includes RMI, <code>java.lang.ref.*</code>,
        <code>javax.naming</code>, and <code>javax.transaction</code>.</li>
    <li>Property files and other system resources can be compiled into
        executables which use libgcj using the new <code>gcj -R</code>
        feature.</li>
    <li>libgcj has been ported to more platforms.  In particular there
        is now a mostly-functional mingw32 target port.</li>
    <li>gcj can now use builtins functions for certain known methods,
        for instance <code>Math.cos</code>.  gcj also has a new
        <code>--no-store-checks</code> optimization option.</li>
    <li>The following thrd party interface standards were added to
        libgcj: <code>org.w3c.dom</code> and <code>org.xml.sax</code>.</li>
    <li><code>java.security</code> has been merged with GNU
        Classpath. The new package is now JDK 1.2 compliant, and much
        more complete.</li>
    <li>A bytecode verifier was added to the libgcj interpreter.</li>
    <li><code>java.lang.Character</code> was rewritten to comply with
        the Unicode 3.0 standard.</li>
    <li>Partial support for many more locales was added to libgcj.</li>
    <li>Fortran improvements are listed in              
        <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/g77_news.html">the Fortran
        documentation</a>.</li>
  </ul>


<h2>New Targets and Target Specific Improvements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.suse.com">SuSE Labs</a> developers Jan
    Hubicka, Bo Thorsen and Andreas Jaeger have contributed a port to
    the AMD x86-64 architecture.  For more information on x86-64 see
    <a href="http://www.x86-64.org">http://www.x86-64.org</a>.</li>
    <li>Hans-Peter Nilsson has contributed a port to <a
    href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix.html">MMIX</a>,
    the CPU architecture used in new editions of Donald E. Knuth's The Art
    of Computer Programming.</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.axis.com/">Axis Communications</a> has
    contributed its port to the CRIS CPU architecture, used in the ETRAX
    system-on-a-chip series.  See <a
    href="http://developer.axis.com/">developer.axis.com</a> for technical
    information.</li>
