<h1>GCC 3.1 Changes, New Features, and Fixes</h1>

<ul>
  <li>General Optimizer Improvements
  <ul>
    <li>dummy</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>New Languages and Language specific improvements
  <ul>
    <li>A few more <a href="c99status.html">ISO C99 features</a>.</li>
    <li>The preprocessor is 10-50% faster than the preprocessor in GCC
        3.0.</li>
    <li>The preprocessor's symbol table has been merged with the
        symbol table of the C, C++ and Objective-C front ends.</li>
    <li>The preprocessor consumes less memory than the preprocessor in
        GCC 3.0, often significantly so.  On normal input files, it
        typically consumes less memory than pre-3.0 cccp-based GCC,
        too.</li>

    <li>libgcj now includes RMI, <code>java.lang.ref.*</code>,
        <code>javax.naming</code>, and <code>javax.transaction</code>.</li>
    <li>Property files and other system resources can be compiled into
        executables which use libgcj using the new <code>gcj -R</code>
        feature.</li>
    <li>libgcj has been ported to more platforms.  In particular there
        is now a mostly-functional mingw32 target port.</li>
    <li>gcj can now use builtins functions for certain known methods,
        for instance <code>Math.cos</code>.  gcj also has a new
        <code>--no-store-checks</code> optimization option.</li>
    <li>The following thrd party interface standards were added to
        libgcj: <code>org.w3c.dom</code> and <code>org.xml.sax</code>.</li>
    <li><code>java.security</code> has been merged with GNU
        Classpath. The new package is now JDK 1.2 compliant, and much
        more complete.</li>
    <li>A bytecode verifier was added to the libgcj interpreter.</li>
    <li><code>java.lang.Character</code> was rewritten to comply with
        the Unicode 3.0 standard.</li>
    <li>Partial support for many more locales was added to libgcj.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
