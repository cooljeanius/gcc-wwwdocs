<title>GCC 3.1 Release Criteria</title>
</head>

<body>

<p><big>This document is still in its larval stage, and should not yet be
taken as canonical.  Most of the text is only a placeholder.</big></p>

<h1>GCC 3.1 Release Criteria</h1>

<p>This page provides the release criteria for GCC 3.1.  GCC 3.1 will
not be released until these criteria have been met.  This page
enumerates the release criteria and provides a rationale for some of
the choices made in determining these criteria.</p>

<p>In all cases, these criteria represent the minimum functionality
required in order to make the release.  If this level of minimum
functionality is not provided by a release candidate, then that
candidate will not become the eventual release.  However, a release
candidate that does meet these criteria may not necessarily become the
official release; there may be other unforseen issues that prevent
release.  For example, if support for the Intel Pentium II is required
by the release criteria, it is nevertheless unlikely that GCC 3.1
would be released even though it did not support the Intel
Pentium.</p>

<p>Because the development of GCC is largely dependent on volunteers,
the Steering Committee may eventually have to decide whether to make a
release, even if the criteria here are not met.  For example, if no
volunteer can be found to verify correct operation of a particular
application program on a particular system, then that criterion may be
abandoned.  However, that eventuality should be avoided if at all
possible.</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>

<p>GCC 3.1 will contain considerable improvements in functionality
relative to previous releases of GCC.  Each of these improvements must
be completed before GCC 3.1 is released:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="issues.html">Open Bugs</a></p>
    <p>High-priority open bugs in GNATS will be fixed before the
       GCC 3.1 release.</p>
</li>
<li><p>C preprocessor</p>
    <p></p>
</li>
<li><p>C++ ABI</p>
    <p></p>
</li>
<li><p>C++ Standard Library</p>
    <p></p>
</li>
<li><p>Java Standard Library</p>
    <p></p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Platform Support</h2>

<p>GCC is available on a vast number of platforms.  However, it is not
possible to effectively test GCC in all possible configurations.
Therefore, a smaller number of platforms have been selected as
targets.  The targets chosen represent both the most popular operating
systems and the most popular microprocessors.  Of course, where
possible, the release will support other targets as well.</p>

<table align="center">
<caption>Primary Evaluation Platforms</caption>
<tr><th>Chip</th>     <th>OS</th>                  <th>Triplet</th></tr>

</table>

<p>GCC's performance on the following platforms will not be required
to meet all the criteria mentioned in this document before GCC 3.1
ships, but the performance on these systems will be of considerable
interest, and it is likely that serious problems on these platforms
will delay the release.</p>

<p>Among the secondary evaluation platforms, we are are especially
concerned about free systems (i.e., GNU/Linux and the BSDs) where GCC
also serves as the system compiler.</p>

<p>Volunteers will be required, both to test and to fix bugs, for all
secondary platforms.  (These volunteers may be the same person, but
volunteers should be careful not to sign up for more work than they can
actually do.)  If volunteers cannot be found for these platforms, then
the secondary platforms will be dropped from this list.</p>

<p>The bug-fixing volunteer will commit to ensuring that GCC 3.1 will
at least bootstrap itself on each of these secondary platforms.  That
commitment doesn't necessarily mean fixing bugs personally; for
example, if you are a manager for a company with GCC expertise you
could be the volunteer if you'll commit to donating your employee's
efforts as necessary.  The release manager, and the GCC development
team, will make reasonable efforts to assist these volunteers by
answering questions and reviewing patches as time permits.</p>

<h2>Language Support</h2>

<p>There are GCC front-ends for many different languages.  However, in
this release, only the behavior of front-ends for the following
languages will be considered part of the release criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>C</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Fortran</li>
</ul>

<p>The following languages will be supported by the release, but their
behavior will not be a primary consideration in determining whether or
not to ship a particular release candidate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ada</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Objective-C</li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, no application testing, code quality, or compile-time
performance testing will be required for these languages.  However,
the regression testing criteria documented below will apply to these
languages.</p>

<h2>Regression Tests</h2>

<p>The GCC testsuite contains extensive C and C++ regression tests, as
well as some Fortran, and Objective-C tests.  GCC 3.1 will not fail
any of these tests which the previous release GCC passed on any of the
supported platforms.  In particular, the current regression testsuite
will be run using GCC 3.0.2 and GCC 2.95.3 on each of the supported
platforms; those results can then be compared with the output from a
release candidate.
Because there have often been issues with generating PIC code, we will
test with <code>-fPIC</code> as well.</p>

<p>In addition, on all supported platforms, there will be no
<code>--enable-checking</code> failures when running any of the
regression test-suites.</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p>In addition to the regression-testing mentioned above, it is
important that operation of the compiler be verified on some real-world
applications.  The following applications represent a mix of low-level
and high-level code, of numerical and logical programs, and of
different programming languages.</p>

<p>These selections were made for a variety of reasons.  The Linux kernel is
one of the most important pieces of free software, and kernel developers pay
careful attention to GCC performance.  It would be an embarrassment to GCC
3.1 if it did not compile the kernel correctly, out of the box.  The kernel
taxes many of the low-level aspects of GCC, as well as many GCC extensions,
including the extended assembly syntax, addresses of labels, and so forth.
(Historically, there have been kernel bugs, found only by more aggressive
optimization in new releases of GCC.  If such bugs are encountered, then
appropriate patches should be applied to the kernel before testing.)</p>

<p>GNU Emacs is portable to almost every system available, and is a complex
application-level C program, known to have very few bugs.</p>

<p>POOMA is a complex expression-template library that will tax the ability
of G++ to deal with templates, an area that has historically been buggy.
In addition, templates have historically taken inordinately much time and
memory at compile-time.  With the widespread prevalence of templates in
C++ programs, including the standard library, testing this area heavily is
vitally important.  For instructions on how to set up and build POOMA and
check the outcome of its testing programs see <a href="pooma-guide.html">
this guide</a>.</p>

<p>LAPACK is a well known linear algebra package that contains code
typical for large scale Fortran programs.  For instructions on how to set
up and build LAPACK and check the outcome of its testing programs see <a
href="lapack-guide.html"> this guide</a>.</p>

<p>As progress is made towards the release, specific information about how
these programs should be compiled, and how their correct operation should
be verified will be made available here.  In general, however, the purpose
will not be to exhaustively test these applications; instead, testers
should simply verify that they compile, and perform basic functionality
correctly.</p>

<h2>Code Quality</h2>

<p>Historically, there has been no formal release criterion that took into
account performance of code generated by the compiler.  It is important that
the generated code performs approximately as well as previous releases.
Therefore, we will use the following benchmarks for measuring code
quality:</p>

<table align="center">
<tr><th align="left">Name</th>
    <th align="left">Language</th>
    <th align="left">Source URL</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>gzip 1.2.4a</td><td>C</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Stepanov</td><td>C++</td>
    <td><a href="ftp://ftp.kai.com/pub/benchmarks/stepanov_v1p2.C">
         stepanov_v1p2.C</a></td>
</tr>
<tr><td>LAPACK</td><td>Fortran</td>
    <td><a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapack.tgz">
        LAPACK 3.0 (timing programs)</a></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>A Java benchmark is not required for this release since there is little
precedent for the behavior of the Java compiler.  For Java, functional
completeness and correctness are still more important than optimization.</p>

<p>In addition to the above benchmarks, the behavior of real
programs should be considered as well.  For that reason, the
behavior of the elliptic curve integer factorization program <a
href="ftp://ftp.loria.fr/pub/loria/eureca/tmp/GMP-ECM/ecm4c.c">ecm4c.c</a>,
which uses GNU mp, will be considered part of the release criteria.</p>

<p>A release candidate will be deemed unacceptable if the performance of
the generated code is not at least as good as that of GCC 2.95.2 on the
benchmarks, and within at least 5% on the application tests.</p>

<h2>Compile-Time Performance</h2>

<p>There is a perception that development snapshots take longer to compile
programs than their 2.95.2 counterparts, and that they often use more memory
as well.  Compile-time performance is an important part of compiler quality.
It is not enough simply to provide additional optimizations; the compiler
must also continue to compile programs relatively quickly.  However, it
is to be expected that additional optimizations and additional features
will have a non-zero cost.</p>

<p>In order to measure compile-time performance, we will use the
following unit tests:</p>
<table>
<tr><th align="left">Name</th>
    <th align="left">Language</th>
    <th align="left">Source</th>
    <th align="left">Flags</th>
    <th align="left">Comments</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>insn-attrtab.c</td>
    <td>C</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>-O2</td>
    <td>This file contains a large machine-generated switch
        statement; it is a reasonable benchmark for testing flow
        optimizations and for handling large functions.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td></td>
    <td>C++</td>
</tr>
<tr><td></td>
    <td>Fortran</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>In addition to these unit tests, we will measure the time and peak
memory usage used when building the entire GNU Emacs distribution with
both GCC 2.95.2 and GCC 3.1.</p>

<p>If the release candidate's compile-time exceeds GCC 2.95.2 by more than
15%, or if the peak memory usage exceeds that of GCC 2.95.2 by more than
25%, that candidate will be deemed unacceptable.</p>

<h2>Open Issues</h2>

<p>The following issues are as of yet unresolved:</p>

<ul>
<li>What integration tests should be used for Fortran?</li>
<li>What other tests should we use for compile-time performance
measurement?</li>
<li>What tests should we use for code quality?</li>
<li>Should we use flags higher than <code>-O2 -g</code> when
bootstrapping?  (Probably we should have a matrix of various flags, as
in previous releases.)</li>
<li>Should we add PowerPC GNU/Linux to the list of platforms?</li>
<li>Should we use Tru64 in place of Alpha GNU/Linux?</li>
<li>Which open bugs need to be fixed?</li>
</ul>
