#! /bin/sh
#
# This script takes a directory tree containing web pages (i.e., HTML,
# JPEG,... files) and copies it into another tree or generates a new
# tree.  If filenames are passed on the command-line, only those files
# are processed.
#
# HTML files are processed by means of MetaHTML using the style sheet
# $STYLE. HTML files in the destination tree are overwritten if and only if
# the new version is different from the old version modulo lines containing
# the string indicated by $IGNORE_DIFF_MARKER.
#
# When processing HTML files, the environment variable PREPROCESS_FILE
# is set to the name of the current file (relative to the document root)
# and can be accessed by MetaHTML commands.
#
# Files called .htaccess or .htpasswd are copied if the copy in the
# destination tree differs from the one in the source tree (or does
# not exist).
#
# GIF files are warned about and ignored; all other files are just copied.
#
# Command-line options:
#
#  -r   Remove cruft, i.e., files and directories that exist in the
#       target tree but not in the source tree from the former.
#
#  -v   Verbose output, especially concerning the -r option.
#
# As a special case for compatibility with existing installations, if
# there is no command-line parameter at all, we assume -r.
